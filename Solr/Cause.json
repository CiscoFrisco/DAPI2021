When found in nature,Francisella tularensiscan survive for several weeks at low temperatures in animal carcasses, soil, and water. In the laboratory,F. tularensisappears as small rods (0.2 by 0.2 m), and is grown best at 3537 C.This species was discovered in ground squirrels inTulare County, California, in 1911;Bacterium tularensewas soon isolated by George Walter McCoy (18761952) of the US Plague Lab in San Francisco and reported in 1912. In 1922, Dr. Edward Francis (18721957), a physician and medical researcher from Ohio, discovered thatBacterium tularensewas the causative agent oftularemia, after studying several cases of his patients having symptoms of the said disease. Later, it became known as \"Francisella tularensis\", in honor of the discovery by Dr. Francis.Four subspecies (biovars) ofF. tularensishave been classified:"

    "overview_t": "Protozoa(alsoprotozoan, pluralprotozoans) is an informal term for a group ofsingle-celledeukaryotes, either free-living orparasitic, which feed on organic matter such as othermicroorganismsor organic tissues and debris.Historically, protozoans were regarded as \"one-celled animals\", because they often possessanimal-like behaviours, such asmotilityandpredation, and lack acell wall, as found in plants and manyalgae.Although the traditional practice of grouping protozoa with animals is no longer considered valid, the term continues to be used in a loose way to describe single-celledprotists(that is, eukaryotes that aren't animals,plants, orfungi) that feed byheterotrophy.Some examples of protozoa areAmoeba,Paramecium,EuglenaandTrypanosoma.In some systems ofbiological classification, Protozoa remains a high-leveltaxonomic group. When first introduced byGeorg Goldfussin 1818, Protozoa was erected as aclasswithin the animals,and its etymology is literally \"first animals\". In later classification schemes it was elevated to a variety of higher ranks, includingphylum,subkingdomandkingdom, and sometimes included within Protoctista orProtista.With the advent of techniques such asmolecular phylogenetics, it was realized that Protozoa did not represent anatural group; but while it is not an accepted taxon incladistic analyses, some systematists continue to use it as a formal taxon."

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known aspathogens, fromvirusestoparasitic worms, anddistinguishthem from the organism's own healthytissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: theinnate immune systemand theadaptive immune system.  Both subsystems usehumoral immunityandcell-mediated immunityto perform their functions.  In humans, thebloodbrain barrier,bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from theneuroimmune system, which protects thebrain.Pathogens can rapidlyevolveand adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simpleunicellularorganisms such asbacteriapossess a rudimentary immune system in the form ofenzymesthat protect againstbacteriophageinfections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancienteukaryotesand remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms includephagocytosis,antimicrobial peptidescalleddefensins, and thecomplement system.Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity createsimmunological memoryafter an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis ofvaccination."

Since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth, while also having three isotopes with half-lives on the order of several billion years, radon will be present on Earth long into the future despite of its short half-life. The decay of radon produces many other short-livednuclides, known asradon daughters, ending at stable isotopes oflead.Unlike all other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains, radon is, under standard conditions, gaseous and easily inhaled, and therefore a health hazard. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual'sbackground radiationdose, but due to local differences in geology,the level of exposure to radon gas differs from place to place.

It is also the process of elimination of dissolved inert gases from the diver's body, which occurs during the ascent, largely during pauses in the ascent known as decompression stops, and after surfacing until the gas concentrations reach equilibrium. Divers breathing gas at ambient pressure need to ascend at a rate determined by their exposure to pressure and the breathing gas in use.  A diver who only breathes gas at atmospheric pressure whenfree-divingorsnorkellingwill not usually need to decompress, Divers using anatmospheric diving suitdo not need to decompress as they are never exposed to high ambient pressure.When a diver descends in the water thehydrostatic pressure, and therefore the ambient pressure, rises. Becausebreathing gasis supplied at ambientpressure, some of this gas dissolves into the diver's blood and is transferred by the blood to other tissues. Inert gas such asnitrogenorheliumcontinues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver'slungs, at which point the diver issaturatedfor that depth and breathing mixture, or the depth, and therefore the pressure, is changed.  During ascent, the ambient pressure is reduced, and at some stage the inert gases dissolved in any given tissue will be at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state and start to diffuse out again. If the pressure reduction is sufficient, excess gas may form bubbles, which may lead todecompression sickness, a possibly debilitating or life-threatening condition. It is essential that divers manage their decompression to avoid excessive bubble formation and decompression sickness.  A mismanaged decompression usually results from reducing the ambient pressure too quickly for the amount of gas in solution to be eliminated safely.  These bubbles may block arterial blood supply to tissues or directly cause tissue damage.  If the decompression is effective, theasymptomaticvenous microbubblespresent after most dives are eliminated from the diver's body in thealveolar capillary bedsof the lungs. If they are not given enough time, or more bubbles are created than can be eliminated safely, the bubbles grow in size and number causing the symptoms and injuries of decompression sickness. The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver, and the long-term goal is to avoid complications due tosub-clinicaldecompression injury."

The terminology follows zoological terms, rather than mycological terms, reflecting the initial misdetermination as aprotozoanparasite. It is an extracellular fungus. All stages are found in lungs and because they cannot be culturedex vivo, direct observation of livingPneumocystisis difficult. The trophozoite stage is thought to be equivalent to the so-called vegetative state of other species (such asSchizosaccharomyces pombe) which, likePneumocystis, belong to theTaphrinomycotinabranch of the fungal kingdom.The trophozoite stage is single-celled and appearsamoeboid(multilobed) and closely associated with host cells. Globular cysts eventually form that have a thicker wall. Within theseascus-like cysts, eight spores form which are released through rupture of the cyst wall. The cysts often collapse forming crescent-shaped bodies visible in stained tissue. Whethermeiosistakes place within the cysts, or what the genetic status is of the various cell types is not known for certain."

Overall body length can reach up to several meters; however, this can vary depending on host species as well as other factors.The scolex is the spoon shaped anterior portion of the worm and consists of the head with attachments. Instead of hooks and distinct suckers (like most tape worms),S. erinaceieuropaeihave two bothria.Bothria are grooves on the scolex that contain weak muscles that perform a sucking action. The neck is unsegmented and located between the scolex and the rest of the body.The proglottids make up the remainder of the body (everything after the neck), and together are termed the strobilia.  As proglottids mature, they develop two sets of reproductive organs, one male and one female. Each proglottid is capable of reproducing via self fertilization.Eggs are typically ovoid in shape with tapered ends.Finally, should the head and neck be severed from one or all of the proglottids,S. erinaceieuropaeican regenerate a new body."

These stages areprophase,prometaphase,metaphase,anaphase, andtelophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated, condense and attach to spindlefibersthat pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells.The different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time, usinglive cell imaging.Producing three or more daughter cells instead of the normal two is a mitotic error called tripolar mitosis or multipolar mitosis (direct cell triplication / multiplication).Other errors during mitosis can induceapoptosis(programmed cell death) or causemutations.

Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis orsepticaemia(infection of the blood) is suspected, intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital.This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence ofNeisseria meningitidisas the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reducedchance of death."

The process is characterized by changes at the cellular,genetic, andepigeneticlevels and abnormalcell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost alltissuesand under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form ofapoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues andorgans. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the somatic mutation theory,mutationsinDNAandepimutationsthat lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and theevolution of those cellsbynatural selectionin the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.Variants of inherited genes may predispose individuals to cancer. In addition, environmental factors such ascarcinogensand radiation cause mutations that may contribute to the development of cancer. Finally random mistakes in normal DNA replication may result in cancer causing mutations.A series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell.On average, for example, 15 \"driver mutations\" and 60 \"passenger\" mutations are found in colon cancers.Mutations in genes that regulate cell division,apoptosis(cell death), andDNA repairmay result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer."

Shiga was impressed by Dr. Kitasato's intellect and confidence, so after graduating, he went to work for him as a research assistant at Institute for Infectious Diseases. In 1897, Shiga focused his efforts on what the Japanese referred to as a \"Sekiri\" (dysentery) outbreak. These epidemics were detrimental to the Japanese people and occurred often in the late 19th century. The 1897sekiriepidemic affected >91,000, with a mortality rate of >20%.Shiga studied 32 dysentery patients and usedKoch's Postulatesto successfully isolate and identify the bacterium causing the disease.

Atherosclerosis is the primary cause ofcoronary artery disease(CAD) and stroke, with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a surprisingly long list of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor.The signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis may include sudden weakness, facial or lower limb numbness, confusion, difficulty understanding speech, and problems seeing."

The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954.Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protectiveantigen(PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) andlethal factor(LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components areendocytosed. In theendosome, the enzymatic components of the toxintranslocateinto thecytoplasmof a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed formacrophagecells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade theimmune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal.Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation ofmacromolecular assemblies, and onprotein translocation, pore formation,endocytosis, and otherbiochemicalprocesses.Anthrax is a disease caused byBacillus anthracis, a spore-forming,Gram positive, rod-shaped bacterium (Fig. 1). The lethality of the disease is caused by the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: (i) thepolyglutamic acidcapsule, which is anti-phagocytic, and (ii) the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of threeproteincomponents: (i) protectiveantigen(PA), (ii)edemafactor (EF), and (iii) lethal factor (LF)."

Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat.For example, contaminated poultry feed is suspected in the findings of high percentages of samples of aflatoxin-contaminated chicken meat and eggs in the Indian subcontinent.Children are particularly affected by aflatoxin exposure, which is associated with stunted growth,delayed development,liver damage, and liver cancer. An association between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposurehas been reported in some studiesbut could not be detected in all.Furthermore, a causal relationship between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure has yet to be conclusively shown by epidemiological studies, though such investigations are under way.Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is immune. Aflatoxins are among the mostcarcinogenicsubstances known.After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactiveepoxideintermediate or hydroxylated to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1."

The specific name refers to theCayetano Heredia Universityin Lima, Peru, where early epidemiological and taxonomic work was done.The first published report ofCyclospora cayetanensisin humans appears to be by Ashford (1979), who found unidentifiedIsospora-likecoccidiain the feces of three individuals in Papua, New Guinea. The photomicrographs in the paper reveal an organism morphologically identical to that seen now. Later, Narango et al. (1989) reported what may be the same organism from several Peruvians with chronic diarrhea and termed the organismCryptosporidium murislike. Other investigators thought the unsporulatedoocystsappeared more similar tocyanobacteria, and the name \"cyanobacterium-like body\" or CLB became prevalent in the literature (occasionally, authors also used the term \"coccidian-like body\", or CLB). Eventually, Ortega et al. (1992) published an abstract reporting that they had sporulated and excysted the oocysts, resulting in placement of the parasite in the genusCyclospora. They also created the nameCyclospora cayetanensisat this time. However, since no morphologic information was presented in the abstract,C. cayetanensistechnically became anomen nudum(a named species without a description). Although Ortega et al. (1993) later published additional details about this coccidian, a complete morphologic description was not published to validate the name until 1994.Thus, the correct name for this parasite isCyclospora cayetanensisOrtega, Gilman, & Sterling, 1994, and the etymology of thenomen trivialeis derived from Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru.

Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal andtort law.Traditionally,common lawlegal systems had separate definitions for assault andbattery. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into assault and battery, which then became widely referred to as \"assault\". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems ofcivil lawandScots lawhave never distinguished assault from battery."

The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemicalmoieties; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to beingnon-polarand lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to theLondon dispersion forcethanhydrocarbons.PFOA is used for several industrial applications, including carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, fire fighting foam and sealants.

Newborns will typically not develop a primary syphilitic chancre, but may present with signs of secondary syphilis (i.e. generalized body rash). Often these babies will develop syphiliticrhinitis(\"snuffles\"), the mucus from which is laden with theT. pallidumbacterium, and therefore highly infectious. Rarely, the symptoms of syphilis go unseen in infants so that they develop the symptoms oflatent syphilis, including damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain.This is a subset of cases of congenital syphilis. Newborns may be asymptomatic and are only identified on routineprenatal screening. If not identified and treated, these newborns develop poor feeding andrunny nose. By definition, early congenital syphilis occurs in children between 0 and 2 years old.After, they can developlate congenital syphilis."

These events have profoundpsychological,physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998study on adverse childhood experiencesdetermined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthyself-destructive behaviors,risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises.Nearly 30 years of study following the initial study has confirmed this. Many states, health providers, and other groups now routinely screen parents and children for ACEs.Traumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual'sallostatic loadand thus affects theimmune system,nervous system, andendocrine system.Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes includingdepression,hypertension,autoimmune diseases,lung cancer, and premature mortality.Effects of childhood trauma onbrain developmentincludes a negative impact onemotional regulationand impairment of development ofsocial skills.Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior.Recent research has found that physical and sexual abuse are associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood, while personality disorders and schizophrenia are linked with emotional abuse as adults."

In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained in a mixture of aerosol particles and gases and include the pharmacologically active alkaloidnicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas into a form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs.

These are labelled indynamical geneticsasdynamic mutations.Triplet expansion is caused byslippageduring DNA replication, also known as \"copy choice\" DNA replication.Due to the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence in these regions, 'loop out' structures may form during DNA replication while maintaining complementary base pairing between the parent strand and daughter strand being synthesized. If the loop out structure is formed from the sequence on the daughter strand this will result in an increase in the number of repeats. However, if the loop out structure is formed on the parent strand, a decrease in the number of repeats occurs. It appears that expansion of these repeats is more common than reduction. Generally, the larger the expansion the more likely they are to cause disease or increase the severity of disease. Other proposed mechanisms for expansion and reduction involve the interaction of RNA and DNA molecules.In addition to occurring duringDNA replication, trinucleotide repeat expansion can also occur duringDNA repair.When a DNA trinucleotide repeat sequence isdamaged, it may be repaired by processes such ashomologous recombination,non-homologous end joining,mismatch repairorbase excision repair.

Frontal lobe impairment can be detected by recognition of typical clinical signs, use of simple screening tests, and specialist neurological testing.The signs and symptoms of frontal lobe disorder can be indicated bydysexecutive syndromewhich consists of a number of symptoms which tend to occur together.Broadly speaking, these symptoms fall into three main categories; cognitive (movement and speech), emotional or behavioral. Although many of these symptoms regularly co-occur, it is common to encounter patients who have several, but not all of these symptoms. This is one reason why some researchers are beginning to argue that dysexecutive syndrome is not the best term to describe these various symptoms. The fact that many of the dysexecutive syndrome symptoms can occur alone has led some researchersto suggest that the symptoms should not be labelled as a \"syndrome\" as such. Some of the latest imaging researchon frontal cortex areas suggests that executive functions may be more discrete than was previously thought."

Gastric acid is regulated in feedback systems to increase production when needed, such as after a meal. Other cells in the stomach producebicarbonate, a base, tobufferthe fluid, ensuring a regulatedpH. These cells also producemucus aviscousbarrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. Thepancreasfurther produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through thepancreatic ductto theduodenumto neutralize gastric acid passing into thedigestive tract.The main constituent of gastric acid is hydrochloric acid produced by parietal cells in thegastric glandsin the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (calledcanaliculi) from which the hydrochloric acid is secreted into thelumenof the stomach. The pH of gastric acid is 1.5 to 3.5 in the human stomach lumen, a level maintained by theproton pumpH+/K+ATPase.The parietal cell releasesbicarbonateinto the bloodstream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as analkaline tide."

It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and treatment procedures, and natural gas production. It also plays a major role as a radioactive isotope present innuclear fissionproducts, and was a significant contributor to the health hazards from open-air atomic bomb testing in the 1950s, and from theChernobyl disaster, as well as being a large fraction of the contamination hazard in the first weeks in theFukushima nuclear crisis. This is because131I is a majorfission productofuraniumandplutonium, comprising nearly 3% of the total products of fission (by weight). Seefission product yieldfor a comparison with other radioactive fission products.131I is also a major fission product of uranium-233, produced fromthorium.Due to its mode ofbeta decay, iodine-131 is notable for causingmutationand death in cells that it penetrates, and other cells up to several millimeters away. For this reason, high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to killthyroidtissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. For example, children treated with moderate dose of131I for thyroid adenomas had a detectable increase in thyroid cancer, but children treated with a much higher dose did not.Likewise, most studies of very-high-dose131I for treatment ofGraves' diseasehave failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with131I absorption at moderate doses.Thus, iodine-131 is increasingly less employed in small doses in medical use (especially in children), but increasingly is used only in large and maximal treatment doses, as a way of killing targeted tissues.
