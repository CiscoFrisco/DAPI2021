It may also be used as part ofadjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic withchemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is calledradiation oncology.Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging theDNAof cancerous tissue leading tocellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much largerabsorbed dosethere than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.",

Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality chest compressions over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving chest compressions, is only recommended for untrained rescuers.In children, however, only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes, because in children the problem normally arises from a respiratory, rather than cardiac problem.Chest compression to breathing ratios is set at 30 to 2 in adults.",

The stent delivery balloon from the angioplasty catheter is inflated with media to force contact between the struts of the stent and the vessel wall (stent apposition), thus widening the blood vessel diameter. After accessing the blood stream through thefemoralorradial artery, the procedure usescoronary catheterizationto visualise the blood vessels on X-ray imaging. After this, aninterventional cardiologistcan perform  acoronary angioplasty, using aballoon catheterin which a deflated balloon is advanced into the obstructed artery and inflated to relieve the narrowing; certain devices such asstentscan be deployed to keep the blood vessel open. Various other procedures can also be performed.Primary PCIis the urgent use of PCI in people with acuteheart attack, especially where there is evidence of heart damage on theelectrocardiogram. PCI is also used in people after other forms of myocardial infarction orunstable anginawhere there is a high risk of further events. Finally, PCI may be used in people with stableangina pectoris, particularly if the symptoms are difficult to control with medication.

It is provided by an interdisciplinary team which can include physicians, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and dietitians. Palliative care can be provided in a variety of contexts including hospitals, outpatient, skilled-nursing, and home settings.

The procedure is performed under localanaesthesia, usually by way of aspinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by anobstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past.The word \"cerclage\" means \"hoop\" in French, as in the metal hoop encircling a barrel.There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity.",

The chief advantage of proton therapy over other types ofexternal beam radiotherapy(e.g.,radiation therapy, or photon therapy) is that the dose of protons is deposited over a narrow range of depth, which results in minimal entry, exit, or scattered radiation dose to healthy nearby tissues.When evaluating whether to treat a tumor with photon or proton therapy, physicians may choose proton therapy if it is important to deliver a higher radiation dose to targeted tissues while significantly decreasing radiation to nearby organs at risk.TheAmerican Society for Radiation OncologyModel Policy for Proton Beam therapystates that proton therapy is considered reasonable in instances where sparing the surrounding normal tissue cannot be adequately achieved with photon-based radiotherapy and can benefit the patient.

       "treatment_overview":"Aventilatoris a machine that providesmechanical ventilationby moving breathable air into and out of thelungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. Modern ventilators arecomputerizedmicroprocessor-controlledmachines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operatedbag valve mask.  Ventilators are chiefly used inintensive-care medicine,home care, andemergency medicine(as standalone units) and inanesthesiology(as a component of ananesthesia machine).Ventilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the\"Bird respirator\"). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"respirator\" to refer to a protective face-mask.",

       "treatment_overview":"Brachytherapyis a form ofradiotherapywhere a sealedradiation sourceis placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment.BrachyisGreekfor short.  Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment forcervical,prostate,breast,esophagealandskin cancerand can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites.Treatment results have demonstrated that the cancer-cure rates of brachytherapy are either comparable to surgery andexternal beam radiotherapy(EBRT) or are improved when used in combination with these techniques.Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, EBRT andchemotherapy.Brachytherapy contrasts withunsealed source radiotherapy, in which a therapeuticradionuclide(radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope likecobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes,iodine-125orcesium-131for instance) directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place.:Ch. 1",

Art therapy, as acreative arts therapyprofession, originated in the fields of art andpsychotherapyand may vary in definition.There are three main ways that art therapy is employed. The first one is called analytic art therapy. Analytic art therapy is based on the theories that come from analytical psychology, and in more cases, psychoanalysis.Analytic art therapy focuses on the client, the therapist, and the ideas that are transferred between the both of them through art.Another way that art therapy is utilized is art psychotherapy. This approach focuses more on the psychotherapist and their analysis of their clients artwork verbally.The last way art therapy is looked at is through the lens of art as therapy. Some art therapists practicing art as therapy believe that analyzing the clients artwork verbally is not essential, therefore they stress the creation process of the art instead.In all of these different approaches to art therapy, the art therapist's client goes on the journey to delve into their inner thoughts and emotions by the use of paint, paper and pen, or even clay.",

Although not fully understood, this processdepolarizesa large amount of theheart muscle, ending the dysrhythmia. Subsequently, the body'snatural pacemakerin thesinoatrial nodeof the heart is able to re-establishnormal sinus rhythm.A heart which is inasystole(flatline) cannot be restarted by a defibrillator, but would be treated bycardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR).In contrast to defibrillation, synchronized electricalcardioversionis an electrical shock delivered in synchrony to thecardiac cycle.Although the person may still becritically ill, cardioversion normally aims to end poorly perfusingcardiac dysrhythmias, such assupraventricular tachycardia.",
