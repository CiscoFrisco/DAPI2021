The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and initiate tissue repair.The fiveclassical signs of inflammationare heat, pain, redness, swelling, andloss of function(Latincalor,dolor,rubor,tumor, andfunctio laesa).Inflammation is a generic response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism ofinnate immunity, as compared toadaptive immunity, which is specific for each pathogen.Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. In contrast, chronic inflammation is associated with various diseases, such ashay fever,periodontal disease,atherosclerosis, andosteoarthritis.",

Toe walking is sometimes caused by a bone block located at the ankle which prevents the antagonist movement, dorsiflexion.

The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.There are two main types of amnesia:retrograde amnesiaandanterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from theshort-termstore into thelong-termstore. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to themedial temporal lobe. In addition, specific areas of thehippocampus(theCA1 region) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of thediencephalonare damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation betweendeficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice.In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recallimmediate informationis still retained,and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition,priming(both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of freshnon-declarativeknowledge.Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.",

By correlating clinical observation with surgical and autopsy findings, Trousseau recognized that a localized cancer could induce a generalizedhypercoagulablestate in which thrombosis could occur elsewhere in the body, such as in extremities with visceral malignancy. Trousseau described several cases in which recurrent thrombosis was the presenting feature of visceral cancer, and his confidence in the utility of this connection led him to say, \"So great, in my opinion, is thesemioticvalue of phlegmasia in the cancerouscachexia, that I regard this phlegmasia as a sign of the cancerousdiathesisas certain as sanguinolenteffusioninto the serous cavities.\"",

This occurs when a muscle's motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch. If stimuli are delivered slowly enough, the tension in the muscle will relax between successive twitches. If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either unfused (incomplete) or fused (complete).An unfused tetanus is when the muscle fibers do not completely relax before the next stimulus because they are being stimulated at a fast rate; however there is a partial relaxation of the muscle fibers between the twitches.Fused tetanus is when there is no relaxation of the muscle fibers between stimuli and it occurs during a high rate of stimulation.A fused tetanic contraction is the strongest single-unit twitch in contraction.When tetanized, the contracting tension in the muscle remains constant in asteady state. This is the maximal possible contraction.During tetanic contractions, muscles can shorten, lengthen or remain constant length.Tetanic contraction is usually normal (such as when holding up a heavy box). Muscles often exhibit some level of tetanic activity, leading tomuscle tone, in order to maintain posture;for example, in a crouching position, some muscles require sustained contraction to hold the position.

Familial HLH should be suspected if siblings are diagnosed with HLH or if symptoms recur when therapy has been stopped. Each full sibling of a child with familial HLH has a twenty-fivepercent chance of developing the disease, a fifty-percent chance of carrying the defective gene (which is very rarely associated with any risk of disease), and a twenty-fivepercent chance of not being affected and not carrying the gene defect.",

In moderate to severe cases of pectus carinatum, the chest wall is rigidly held in an outward position. Thus, respirations are inefficient and the individual needs to use the accessory muscles for respiration, rather than normal chest muscles, during strenuous exercise. This negatively affects gas exchange and causes a decrease in stamina. Children with pectus malformations often tire sooner than their peers, due to shortness of breath and fatigue.

As with other types ofaphasia, the symptoms that accompany PPA depend on what parts of theleft hemisphereare significantly damaged. However, unlike most other aphasias, PPA results from continuous deterioration in brain tissue, which leads to early symptoms being far less detrimental than later symptoms. Those with PPA slowly lose the ability to speak, write, read, and generally comprehend language. Eventually, almost every patient becomes mute and completely loses the ability to understand both written and spoken language.Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact,it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer from impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss ofexecutive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.Marsel Mesulam in 1982.Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with thefrontotemporal lobar degeneration(FTLD) spectrum of disorders andAlzheimer's disease. However, PPA is not considered synonymous to Alzheimer's disease due to the fact that, unlike those affected by Alzheimer's disease, those with PPA are generally able to maintain the ability to care for themselves, remain employed, and pursue interests and hobbies. Moreover, in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,Pick's disease, andCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive deterioration of comprehension and production of language is just one of the many possible types of mental deterioration, such as the progressive decline of memory, motor skills, reasoning, awareness, and visuospatial skills.Currently, the specific causes for PPA and other degenerative brain disease similar to PPA are unknown. Autopsies have revealed a variety of brain abnormalities in people who had PPA. These autopsies, as well as imaging techniques such as CT scans, MRI, EEG,single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), andpositron emission tomography(PET), have generally revealed abnormalities to be almost exclusively in the left hemisphere.",

Other symptoms related to this may include feelings ofgrandiosity,distractibility, andhypersexuality.While hypomanic behavior often generates productivity and excitement, it can become troublesome if the subject engages in risky or otherwise inadvisable behaviors, and/or the symptoms manifest themselves in trouble with everyday life events.When manic episodes are separated into stages of a progression according to symptomatic severity and associated features, hypomania constitutes the first stage of the syndrome, wherein the cardinal features (euphoriaor heightened irritability,pressure of speechand activity, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and flight of ideas) are most plainly evident.",

Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin.

Foot drop may be temporary or permanent, depending on the extent of muscle weakness or paralysis and it can occur in one or both feet.  In walking, the raised leg is slightly bent at the knee to prevent the foot from dragging along the ground.Foot drop can be caused by nerve damage alone or by muscle or spinal cord trauma, abnormal anatomy, atoxins, or disease. Toxins include organophosphate compounds which have been used aspesticidesand as chemical agents in warfare. The poison can lead to further damage to the body such as a neurodegenerative disorder called organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. This disorder causes loss of function of the motor and sensory neural pathways.  In this case, foot drop could be the result of paralysis due to neurological dysfunction.

Although there is little research overall, there has been compelling initial evidence for personality change. The development of personality is often dependent on the stage of life a person is in, and the extent to which one's levels of characteristics, relative to their age cohort, is stable across long periods of time.Cultural and environmental influence are large factors in personality trait differences.Personality change is usually seen over longer periods of time and is analogical to height, as most development occurs in the earlier stages of life and becomes more stable as one grows into adulthood.The Big Five, or Five Factor Model, is the most widely accepted form of personality theory, and especially in terms of personality change.Research suggests that genetics play a role in the change and stability of certain traits in a personality. They have also discovered environmental and situational/contextual sources affect personality.Some debates have pervaded the field of psychology since its beginning. One of the most debated deals with the nature and development of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style ofcognition, behavior, andaffect. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,while others struggle with issues of measurement.Personality, one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on eachBig Five personality trait(extraversion,neuroticism,openness to experience,agreeablenessandconscientiousness). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or anotherFor example, people are typically categorized asintrovertedorextraverted. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.",

Cognitive deficits are not just spatial in nature, but also include non-spatial functions such as object recognition memory.Vestibular dysfunction has been shown to adversely affect processes of attention and increased demands of attention can worsen the postural sway associated with vestibular disorders.

Cognitive advances and increased pressures in late childhood and early adolescence result in repeated social anxiety. Adolescents have identified their most common anxieties as focused on relationships with peers to whom they areattracted,peer rejection,public speaking,blushing,self-consciousness,panic, and past behavior. Most adolescents progress through their fears and meet the developmental demands placed on them.More and more children are being diagnosed with social anxiety, and this can lead to problems with education if not closely monitored. Part of social anxiety is fear of being criticized by others, and in children, social anxiety causes extreme distress over everyday activities such as playing with other kids, reading in class, or speaking to adults. On the other hand, some children with social anxiety willact outbecause of their fear.

Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of \"wanting\" and \"liking\".  \"Wanting\" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward.  \"Liking\", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward.The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two.Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either \"liking\" or \"wanting\" is lacking.",

Muteness may not be a permanent condition, depending upon etiology (cause).  In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: organic, psychological, developmental/ neurological.For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder. For adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak, loss of speech may be due to injury, disease, termedaphasia, or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur rarely for psychological reasons.Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. When there is an absence of speech, a speech assessment is strongly recommended to determine cause and treatment.Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is determined to be a permanent condition, a range of assistive and augmentative communication devices are available to aid communication.",

One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits.Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding,hypotonia,spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress.Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as thehippocampusand the motorthalamus, as well as thecorpus striatum;therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from severe communication deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance, although most of people with athetosis have normal or near-normal intelligence.",

They suggested that dismemberment involves the entire removal, by any means, of a large section of the body of a living or dead person, specifically, the head (also termed decapitation), arms, hands, torso, pelvic area, legs, or feet. Mutilation, by contrast, involves the removal or irreparable disfigurement, by any means, of some smaller portion of one of those larger sections of a living or dead person. The latter would includecastration(removal of thepenis),evisceration(removal of theinternal organs), andflaying(removal of theskin).

The term edema is from theGreek(oidema, \"swelling\"), from  (oideo, \"I swell\").Classically it is cardiogenic (leftventricular) but fluid may also accumulate due to damage to the lung. This damage may be direct injury or injury mediated by high pressures within the pulmonary circulation. When directly or indirectly caused by increased left ventricular pressure pulmonary edema may form when mean pulmonary pressure rises from the normal of 15 mmHgto above 25 mmHg.Broadly, the causes of pulmonary edema can be divided into cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. By convention cardiogenic refers to left ventricular causes.",

       "symptom_overview":"Hyperaemia(also hyperemia) is the increase of blood flow to different tissues in the body. It can have medical implications but is also a regulatory response, allowing change in blood supply to different tissues throughvasodilation. Clinically, hyperaemia in tissues manifest aserythema(redness of the skin) because of the engorgement of vessels with oxygenated blood.Hyperaemia can also occur due to a fall in atmospheric pressure outside the body. The term is from Greek  (huper, \"over\") +  (haima, blood).Functional hyperaemia is an increase in blood flow to a tissue due to the presence of metabolites and a change in general conditions. When a tissue increases activity there is a well-characterized fall in the partial pressure of oxygen and pH, an increase in  partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and a rise in temperature and the concentration of potassium ions. The mechanisms ofvasodilationare predominantly local metabolites and myogenic effects.  Increased metabolic activity of the tissue leads to a local increase in the extracellular concentration of such chemicals as adenosine, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid, and a decrease in oxygen and pH.  These changes cause significant vasodilation.  The reverse occurs when metabolic activity is slowed and these substances wash out of the tissues.  The myogenic effect refers to the inherent attempt of vascular smooth muscle surrounding arterioles and arteries to maintain the tension in the wall of these blood vessels by dilating when internal pressure is reduced and to constrict when wall tension increases.",
