The virus iszoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched theuddersof infectedcowsand consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands.Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadlysmallpoxdisease.Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairy farmerswere immune to smallpox inspired the modernsmallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physicianEdward Jenner.The word vaccination, coined by Jenner in 1796,is derived from the Latin adjectivevaccinus, meaning of or from the cow.Once vaccinated, a patient developsantibodiesthat make them immune to cowpox, but they also developimmunityto the smallpox virus, orVariola virus. The cowpox vaccinations andlater incarnationsproved so successful that in 1980, theWorld Health Organizationannounced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide.Otherorthopoxviruses remain prevalent in certain communities and continue to infect humans, such as thecowpox virus(CPXV) in Europe, vaccinia in Brazil, andmonkeypox virusin Central and West Africa.",

The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.There are two main types of amnesia:retrograde amnesiaandanterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from theshort-termstore into thelong-termstore. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to themedial temporal lobe. In addition, specific areas of thehippocampus(theCA1 region) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of thediencephalonare damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation betweendeficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice.In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recallimmediate informationis still retained,and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition,priming(both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of freshnon-declarativeknowledge.Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.",

Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. Each patient experiences a different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.Syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people,with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood.

This is followed by multiple changes in the filtration units of the kidneys, thenephrons. (There are normally about 750,0001.5 million nephrons in each adult kidney).Initially, there is constriction of theefferent arteriolesand dilation ofafferent arterioles, with resulting glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration; this gradually changes to hypofiltration over time.Concurrently, there are changes within the glomerulus itself: these include a thickening of thebasement membrane, a widening of the slit membranes of thepodocytes, an increase in the number of mesangial cells, and an increase in mesangial matrix.

Cystinosis is the most common cause ofFanconi syndromein the pediatric age group. Fanconi syndrome occurs when the function of cells inrenal tubulesis impaired, leading to abnormal amounts ofcarbohydratesand amino acids in theurine, excessive urination, and low blood levels ofpotassiumandphosphates.Cystinosis was the first documented genetic disease belonging to the group of lysosomal storage disease disorders.Cystinosis is caused by mutations in theCTNSgene that codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal membrane-specific transporter for cystine. Intracellular metabolism of cystine, as it happens with all amino acids, requires its transport across the cell membrane. After degradation ofendocytosedprotein to cystine within lysosomes, it is normally transported to thecytosol. But if there is a defect in the carrier protein, cystine is accumulated in lysosomes. As cystine is highly insoluble, when its concentration in tissue lysosomes increases, its solubility is immediately exceeded and crystalline precipitates are formed in almost all organs and tissues.",

Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction ofaction potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate out of control in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve. Schwannomas on sensory nerve axons cause chronic severe pain. Treatment options for schwannomas are to surgically remove them, have radiation, cyberknife or Intracapsular Enucleation. Previous designations for schwannomas include neurinoma and neurilemmoma.",

PLMD on the other hand is involuntary, and the patient is often unaware of these movements altogether. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) occurring during daytime period can be found but are considered as a symptom of RLS. Only PLMS during sleep can suggest a diagnosis of PLMD.Periodic limb movement disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of frequent limb movements while sleeping. It mostly happens in the lower parts of the body like the toes, ankles, knees and hips. It can also, in some cases, appear in the upper extremities of the body. These movements can lead the patient to wake up, and if so, sleep interruption can be the origin ofexcessive daytime sleepiness.",

In general, foods and drinks with apHbelow 5.05.7 have been known to trigger dental erosion effects.Numerous clinical and laboratory reports link erosion to excessive consumption of drinks. Those thought to pose a risk are soft drinks, some alcohol and fruit drinks, fruit juices such asorange juice(which containcitric acid) andcarbonated drinkssuch ascolas(in which thecarbonic acidis not the cause of erosion, but citric andphosphoric acid).Additionally,winehas been shown to erode teeth, with the pH of wine as low as 3.03.8.Other possible sources of erosive acids are from exposure tochlorinatedswimming poolwater,and regurgitation ofgastric acids.In children with chronic diseases, the use of medicines with acid components is a risk factor too.Dental erosion has also been recorded in the fossil record and was likely caused by the consumption of acidic fruits or plants.",

Three variants are known to exist, FAP andattenuated FAP(originally calledhereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused byAPC genedefects on chromosome 5 whileautosomal recessive FAP(orMUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in theMUTYHgene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal beforemetastasisoutside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer.The root cause of FAP is understood to be agenetic mutationa change in the body'stumour suppressor genesthat prevent development of tumours. The change allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually reach the end of their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise tocancer(7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). These gene changes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's ability to prevent cells from becoming cancerous. Even with the gene change, it may still take time before a cell actually does develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.",

Often weakness develops on one side of the body before the other. Symptoms typically begin in early childhood and become noticeable in the teenage years, with 95% of affected individuals manifesting disease by age 20 years. Non-muscular manifestations of FSHD includehearing lossand blood vessel abnormalities in theback of the eye.FSHD is caused by complex genetic changes involving theDUX4gene.In those without FSHD,DUX4is expressed (ie: turned on) in early human development and later repressed (ie: turned off) in mature tissues.In FSHD,DUX4is inadequately turned off, which can be caused by several different mutations, the most common being deletion of DNA in the region surroundingDUX4.This mutation is termed \"D4Z4 contraction\" and defines FSHD type 1 (FSHD1), making up 95% of FSHD cases. FSHD due to other mutations is classified as FSHD type 2 (FSHD2). Regardless of which mutation is present, disease can only result if the individual has a 4qA allele, which is a common variation in the DNA next toDUX4.Up to 30% of FSHD cases are due to a new mutation, which then is able to be passed on to children. FSHD1 follows anautosomal dominantinheritance pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of also being affected.HowDUX4expression causes muscle damage is unclear.Expression ofDUX4gene produces DUX4 protein, whose function is to modulate hundreds of other genes, many of which are involved in muscle function.Diagnosis is bygenetic testing.",

These attacks were triggered by exercise or other forms of exertion and relieved by rest andnitroglycerin. In 1959, Dr.Myron Prinzmetaldescribed a type of angina that differed from the classic cases of Heberden angina in that it commonly occurred in the absence of exercise or exertion. Indeed, it often woke sufferers from their normal sleep. This variant angina differed from the classical angina described by Dr. Heberden in that it appeared due to episodicvasospasmof coronary arteries that were typically not occluded by pathological processes such asatherosclerosis,emboli, orspontaneous dissection(i.e. tears in the walls of coronary arteries).Variant angina had been described twice in the 1930s by other authorsand was referred to ascardiac syndrome X(CSX) by Kemp in 1973, in reference to patients with exercise-induced angina who nonetheless had normal coronary angiograms.CSX is now termedmicrovascular angina, i.e. angina caused by disease of the heart's small arteries.",

Free (released) nickel that is able to penetrate theskinis taken up by scavenger (dendritic cells) and then presented to theimmune systemT-Cells. With each subsequent exposure to nickel theseT cellsbecome stimulated and duplicate (clone) themselves. With enough exposures to nickel, the amassing clones of T-cells reach threshold and the skin develops arash. The rash can present as acute, subacute, or chroniceczema-likeskin patches, primarily at the site of contact with the nickel (e.g., earlobe from nickel earrings). From the time of exposure, the rash usually presents within 12120 hours and can last for 34 weeks or for the continued duration of nickel contact/exposure.",

It is asquamous cell carcinomaof an undifferentiated type.Squamous epithelial cellsare a flat type of cell found in the skin and the membranes that line some body cavities. Differentiation means how different the cancer cells are from normal cells.Undifferentiated cellsare cells that do not have their mature features or functionsNPC may present as a lump or a mass on both sides towards the back of the neck. These lumps usually are not tender or painful but appear as a result of the metastatic spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes, thus causing the lymph nodes to swell. Lymph nodes are defined as glands that function as part of the immune system and can be found throughout the body.Swelling of the lymph nodesin the neck is the initial presentation in many people, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph nodebiopsy. Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer may appear as headaches, a sore throat, and trouble hearing, breathing, or speaking.Additional symptoms of NPC include facial pain or numbness, blurred or double vision, trouble opening the mouth, or recurring ear infections. If the ear infection does not present with an upper respiratory tract infection, then an examination should be done on the nasopharynx. This is due to the fact that, in adults, ear infections are less common than in children.Signs and symptoms related to the primary tumor includetrismus, pain,otitis media,nasal regurgitationdue toparesis(loss of or impaired movement) of thesoft palate,hearing lossandcranial nerve palsy(paralysis).

These flesh-colored, red, or bluetumorstypically vary in size from 0.5 cm (less than one-quarter of an inch) to more than 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter and may enlarge rapidly. Tumors can present as painless, tender or itchy, and other MCC manifestations aspapules or plaqueshave also been reported.Although MCC may arise almost anywhere on the body, it is most commonly found in sun-exposed areas such as the head, neck or extremities.Five key attributes of MCC were summarized in 2008 in theacronymAEIOU (Asymptomatic/lack of tenderness, Expanding rapidly, Immune suppression, Older than 50 years, and Ultraviolet-exposed site on a person with fair skin).Ninety percent of MCC's have 3 or more of those features.MCC is sometimes mistaken for otherhistologicaltypes of cancer, includingbasal cell carcinoma,squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma,lymphoma, andsmall cell carcinoma, or as a benigncyst.Merkel cell carcinomas have been described in children, however pediatric cases are very rare.",

Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to ascongenital metabolic diseasesorinherited metabolic disorders.The terminborn errors of metabolismwas coined by a British physician,Archibald Garrod(18571936), in 1908. He is known for work that prefigured the\"one gene-one enzyme\" hypothesis, based on his studies on the nature and inheritance ofalkaptonuria. His seminal text,Inborn Errors of Metabolismwas published in 1923.Traditionally the inherited metabolic diseases were classified as disorders ofcarbohydratemetabolism,amino acidmetabolism,organic acidmetabolism, orlysosomal storage diseases.

EEE was first recognized inMassachusetts, United States, in 1831, when 75horsesdied mysteriously ofviral encephalitis.\r\nEpizootics in horses have continued to occur regularly in the United States. It can also be identified in donkeys and zebras. Due to the rarity of the disease, its occurrence can cause economic impact beyond the cost of horses and poultry.EEE is found today in the eastern part of the United States and is often associated with coastal plains. It can most commonly be found in East Coast and Gulf Coast states.In Florida, about one to two human cases are reported a year, although over 60 cases of equine encephalitis are reported. In years in which conditions  are favorable for the disease, the number of equine cases is over 200.Diagnosing equine encephalitis is challenging because many of the symptoms are shared with other illnesses and patients can be asymptomatic. Confirmations may require a sample of cerebral spinal fluid or brain tissue, although CT scans and MRI scans are used to detect encephalitis. This could be an indication that the need to test for EEE is necessary. If a biopsy of the cerebral spinal fluid is taken, it is sent to a specialized laboratory for testing.Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is closely related toVenezuelan equine encephalitis virusandwestern equine encephalitis virus.",

Bertina under the direction of (and in the laboratory of) Prof P. Reitsma.Despite the increased risk of VTE, people with one copy of this gene have not been found to have shorter lives than the general population.The symptoms of factor V Leiden vary among individuals. There are some individuals who have the F5 gene and who never develop thrombosis, while others have recurring thrombosis before the age of 30 years. This variability is influenced by the number of F5 gene mutations a person has, the presence of other gene alterations related to blood clotting, and circumstantial risk factors, such as surgery, use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy.",

The tumors generally begin in layers of connective tissue such as that under the skin, between muscles, and surrounding organs, and will generally start as a small lump with inflammation that grows. At first the lump will be self-contained as the tumor exists in its stage 1 state, and will not necessarily expand beyond its encapsulated form. However, it may develop cancerous processes that can only be detected through microscopic examination. As such, at this level the tumor is usually treated by excision that includes wide margins of healthy-looking tissue, followed by thorough biopsy and additional excision if necessary. The prognosis for a stage 1 tumor excision is usually fairly positive, but if the tumors progress to levels 2 and 3, prognosis is worse because tumor cells have likely spread to other locations. These locations can either be nearby tissues or system-wide locations that include the lungs, kidneys, and liver. In these cases prognosis is grim andchemotherapyandradiationare the only methods of controlling the cancer.Spindle cell sarcoma can develop for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition but it also may be caused by a combination of other factors including injury and inflammation in patients that are already thought to be predisposed to such tumors. Spindle cells are a naturally occurring part of the body's response to injury. In response to an injury, infection, or other immune response the connective tissues will begin dividing to heal the affected area, and if the tissue is predisposed to spindle cell cancer the high cellular turnover may result in a few becoming cancerous and forming a tumor.",

It is characterized by multiple movement (motor)ticsand at least one vocal (phonic) tic. Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. These are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency. Tourette's is at the more severe end of aspectrumoftic disorders. The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers.Tourette's was once regarded as a rare and bizarresyndromeand has popularly been associated withcoprolalia(the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks). It is no longer considered rare; about 1% of school-age children and adolescents are estimated to have Tourette's,and coprolalia occurs only in a minority. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified, because most cases are mild, and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Therefore, many go undiagnosed or may never seek medical attention. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is rare, but for a small minority, severely debilitating tics can persist into adulthood. Tourette's does not affect intelligence orlife expectancy.",

Individual accommodations, such as specialized furniture, are often used by people with dwarfism.Many support groups provide services to aid individuals and the discrimination they may face.",

Research on Castleman disease is rapidly evolving and the disease is becoming better understood.Castleman disease includes at least three distinct subtypes:unicentric Castleman disease (UCD),human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease (HHV-8-associated MCD), andidiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). These are differentiated by the number and location of affected lymph nodes and the presence of human herpesvirus 8, a known causative agent. Correctly classifying the Castleman disease subtype is important, as the three subtypes vary significantly in symptoms, clinical findings, disease mechanism, treatment approach, and prognosis. In the United States, approximately 6,500 to 7,700 new cases are diagnosed each year.",

They are also known asosteochondromas. Additional sites of occurrence include on flat bones such as the pelvic bone and scapula. The distribution and number of these exostoses show a wide diversity among affected individuals.  Exostoses usually present during childhood. The vast majority of affected individuals become clinically manifest by the time they reach adolescence.A small percentage of affected individuals are at risk for development of malignant transformation namely sarcomas. The incidence of hereditary multiple exostoses is around  1 in 50,000 individuals.Hereditary multiple osteochondromas is the preferred term used by theWorld Health Organization.A noticeable lump in relation to an extremity may be the first presenting symptom. Multiple deformities can arise, namely coronal plane deformities around the knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. For example, genu valgum (knock knees), ankle valgus, ulnar bowing and shortening, and radial head subluxation are encountered. The majority of affected individuals have clinically manifest osteochondromas around the knee. Forearm involvement in  HMO is considerable.Furthermore, short stature may occur and is generally disproportionate. Such manifestations usually result from disruption of physeal growth especially that osteochondromas typically arise at the metaphyseal ends of long bones in close proximity to the physis.Intra-articular osteochondromas of the hip can induce  limitation of range of motion, joint pain and acetabular dysplasia.Likewise joint pain at other locations and neurovascular compression can occur. Furthermore, functional disability in regard to activities of daily living can be a presenting feature. Spinal deformity pain or neurological compromise should arouse suspicion of  involvement of the vertebrae.",

Use of the termvibration white fingerhas generally been superseded in professional usage by broader concept of HAVS, although it is still used by the general public. The symptoms of vibration white finger are the vascular component of HAVS.HAVS is a widespread recognized industrial disease affecting tens of thousands of workers. It is a disorder that affects the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and joints of the hand, wrist, and arm. Its best known effect is vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a term introduced by the Industrial Injury Advisory Council in 1970. Injury can occur at frequencies between 5 and 2000 Hz but the greatest risk for fingers is between 50 and 300 Hz. The total risk exposure for hand and arm is calculated by the use of ISO 5349-1, which stipulates maximum damage between 8 and 16 Hz and a rapidly declining risk at higher frequencies. The ISO 5349-1 frequency risk assessment has been criticized as corresponding poorly to observational data; more recent research suggests that medium and high frequency vibrations also increase HAVS risk.",

With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads topulmonary hypertensionfollowed by right-sidedheart failure.The ductus arteriosus is afetal blood vesselthat normally closes soon after birth. In a PDA, the vessel does not close, but remainspatent(open), resulting in an abnormal transmission of blood from theaortato thepulmonary artery. PDA is common in newborns with persistent respiratory problems such ashypoxia, and has a high occurrence inpremature newborns. Premature newborns are more likely to be hypoxic and have PDA due to underdevelopment of the heart and lungs.",

In comparison to the 1980s there have been fewer published cases in the 1990s. Thus, Nelson's syndrome has become less prevalent.Within the past ten to twenty years, improvements have been made with identification and care for patients withCushing's disease. Improvements have been made with techniques such as pituitaryradiation therapy, ACTH assay,transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, higher resolutionMRIs, and sampling of theinferior petrosal sinus.

Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing thepituitaryhormonesthat inducesex steroidproduction. The opposite condition isdelayed puberty.The term is used with several slightly different meanings that are usually apparent from the context. In its broadest sense, and often simplified asearly puberty, \"precocious puberty\" sometimes refers to any physicalsex hormoneeffect, due to any cause, occurring earlier than the usual age, especially when it is being considered as a medical problem. Stricter definitions of \"precocity\" may refer only to central puberty starting before a statistically specified age based on percentile in the population (e.g., 2.5standard deviationsbelow the population mean),on expert recommendations of ages at which there is more than a negligible chance of discovering an abnormal cause, or based on opinion as to the age at which early puberty may have adverse effects.

       "disease_overview":"Ollier diseaseis a rare sporadic nonhereditary skeletal disorder in which typically benign cartilaginous tumors (enchondromas) develop near the growth plate cartilage. This is caused by cartilage rests that grow and reside within themetaphysisordiaphysisand eventually mineralize over time to form multiple enchondromas.Key signs of the disorder include asymmetry and shortening of the limb as well as an increased thickness of the bone margin. These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age.Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bonesarcomasthat necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm. Cases in patients with Ollier disease has shown a link to IDH1, IDH2, and PTH1R gene mutations. Currently, there are no forms of treatment for the underlying condition of Ollier disease but complications such as fractures, deformities, malignancies that arise from it can be treated through surgical procedures. The prevalence of this condition is estimated at around 1 in 100,000.It is unclear whether the men or women are more affected by this disorder due to conflicting case studies.The disease consists of the growth multipleenchondromaswhich usually develop in early childhood. The growth of these enchondromas usually stops after skeletal maturation.The affected extremity is shortened (asymmetric dwarfism) and sometimes bowed due to epiphyseal fusion anomalies. Bone lesions generally present as cellular during childhood and become more solitary over time. People with Ollier disease are prone to breaking bones(fractures)and normally have swollen, aching limbs. However, many cases of solitary enchondromata go unnoticed due to lack of symptoms. Enchondromas are commonly found in the phalanges, metacarpal, and metatarsal bones in patients of Ollier disease due to the affinity of enchondromas to long tubular bones such as the femur and humerus. A unilateral distribution of bone lesions is usually observed but bilateral distributions or a singular extremity can occur as well. Approximately a third of the cases show some form of physical deformities of bowing or abnormal limb lengthening.",

Early dumping syndrome occurs 10 to 30 minutes after a meal. It results from rapid movement of fluid into the intestine following a sudden addition of a large amount of food from the stomach.The small intestine expands rapidly due to the presence ofhypertonic/hyperosmolarcontents from the stomach, especially sweet foods.

HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deterioratingliverfunction is believed to cause changes in thecirculation that supplies the intestines, alteringblood flowand blood vessel tone in thekidneys. The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition.

Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot, or a piece of the clot, that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as anembolus.Thrombosis may occur in veins (venous thrombosis) or in arteries (arterial thrombosis). Venous thrombosis leads to congestion of the affected part of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemiaandnecrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as anembolism. This type of embolism is known as athromboembolism. Complications can arise when avenous thromboembolism(commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as apulmonary embolism. An arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism.",

Usually DLBCL arises from normal B cells, but it can also represent amalignant transformationof other types of lymphoma (particularlymarginal zone lymphomas) or, in rare cases termedRichter's transformation,chronic lymphocytic leukemia.An underlyingimmunodeficiencyis a significant risk factor for development of the disease.Infections with theEpsteinBarr virus(EBV),Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus,human immunodeficiency virus(i.e. HIV),and theHelicobacter pyloribacteriumare also associated with the development of certain subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, most cases of this disease are associated with the unexplained step-wise acquisition of increasing numbers of gene mutations and changes in gene expression that occur in, and progressively promote the malignant behavior of, certain B-cell types.",

It is also the inability to establish and sustain adequate or spontaneous respiration upon delivery of the newborn. It remains a serious condition which causes significant mortality and morbidity. It is an emergency condition and requires adequate and quick resuscitation measures.Perinatal asphyxia is also an oxygen deficit from the 28th week of gestation to the first seven days following delivery. It is also an insult to the fetus or newborn due to lack of oxygen or lack of perfusion to various organs and may be associated with a lack of ventilation. In accordance with WHO, perinatal asphyxia is characterised by-                                   Profound metabolic acidosis, with a PH <7.20 on umbilical cord arterial blood sample, Persistence of an APGAR score of 3 at the 5th minute,                                                           Clinical neurologic sequelae in the immediate neonatal period,Evidence  of multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period.

In more pronounced cases, an infant will survive, but with damage to the brain manifested as either mental, such asdevelopmental delayorintellectual disability, or physical, such asspasticity.It results most commonly from antepartum causes like a drop in maternalblood pressureor some other substantial interference with blood flow to the infant'sbrainduringdelivery. This can occur due to inadequatecirculationorperfusion, impaired respiratory effort, or inadequateventilation. Perinatal asphyxia happens in 2 to 10 per 1000 newborns that are born at term, and more for those that are born prematurely.WHO estimates that 4 million neonatal deaths occur yearly due to birth asphyxia, representing 38% of deaths of children under 5 years of age.",

A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7mmol/l(100126mg/dl) (American Diabetes Associationguidelines) is considered slightly hyperglycemic, and above 7mmol/l(126mg/dl) is generally held to havediabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too hyperglycemic can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person'srenal threshold of glucoseand overall glucose tolerance. On average, however, chronic levels above 1012 mmol/L (180216 mg/dl) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.The degree of hyperglycemia can change over time depending on the metabolic cause, for example, impaired glucose tolerance or fasting glucose, and it can depend on treatment.Temporary hyperglycemia is often benign and asymptomatic. Blood glucose levels can rise well above normal and cause pathological and functional changes for significant periods without producing any permanent effects or symptoms.During this asymptomatic period, an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism can occur which can be tested by measuring plasma glucose.Chronic hyperglycemia at above normal levels can produce a very wide variety of serious complications over a period of years, including kidney damage, neurological damage, cardiovascular damage,damage to the retinaor damage to feet and legs.Diabetic neuropathymay be a result of long-term hyperglycemia.

The EEG demonstrates characteristic \"typical 3Hz spike-wave\" discharges. Prognosis is excellent in well-defined cases of CAE with most patients \"growing out\" of their epilepsy.CAE is acomplex polygenic disorder.

Whileanxiety disorders,mood disorders, andpsychotic disorderscan also have an effect on cognitive and memory functions, theDSM-IV-TRdoes not consider these cognitive disorders, because loss of cognitive function is not the primary (causal) symptom.Additionally, developmental disorders such asautism spectrum disorderare typically developed at birth or early in life as opposed to the acquired nature of neurocognitive disorders.",

Although fluoride is safe for dental health at low concentrations, sustained consumption of large amounts of solublefluoridesaltsis dangerous.  Referring to a common salt of fluoride,sodium fluoride(NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).Ingestion of fluoride can producegastrointestinaldiscomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.20.3 mg/kg or 10 to 15 mg for a 50 kg person) than lethal doses.Although it is helpful topically for dental health in low dosage, chronic ingestion of fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. In this way, the most widespread examples of fluoride poisoning arise from consumption of ground water that is abnormally fluoride-rich.For optimal dental health, theWorld Health Organizationrecommends a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L (milligrams per liter), depending on climate.Fluorosis becomes possible above this recommended dosage.  As of 2015, theUnited States Health and Human Services Departmentrecommends a maximum of 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water  updating and replacing the previous recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams issued in 1962.

EDS can be considered as a broad condition encompassing severalsleep disorderswhere increased sleep is a symptom, or as a symptom of another underlying disorder likenarcolepsy,circadian rhythm sleep disorder,sleep apneaoridiopathic hypersomnia.Some persons with EDS, including those withhypersomniaslike narcolepsy andidiopathic hypersomnia, are compelled to nap repeatedly during the day; fighting off increasingly strong urges to sleep during inappropriate times such as while driving, while at work, during a meal, or in conversations. As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of intoxication. During occasional unique and/or stimulating circumstances, a person with EDS can sometimes remain animated, awake and alert, for brief or extended periods of time.  EDS can affect the ability to function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. A proper diagnosis of the underlying cause and ultimately treatment of symptoms and/or the underlying cause can help mitigate such complications.",

Partial seizures occurring in the frontal lobes can occur in one of two different forms: eithersimple partial seizures(that do not affect awareness or memory) orcomplex partial seizures(that affect awareness or memory either before, during or after a seizure). The symptoms and clinical manifestations of frontal lobe epilepsy can differ depending on which specific area of the frontal lobe is affected.The onset of a seizure may be hard to detect since the frontal lobes contain and regulate many structures and functions about which relatively little is known. Due to the lack of knowledge surrounding the functions associated with the frontal lobes, seizures occurring in these regions of the brain may produce unusual symptoms which can often be misdiagnosed as apsychiatric disorder,non-epileptic seizureor a sleep disorder.",

This personality disorder is a long-term conditionin which people depend on others to meet their emotional and physical needs, with only a minority achieving normal levels of independence. Dependent personality disorder is aCluster C personality disorder,characterized by excessive fear and anxiety. It begins by early adulthood, and it is present in a variety of contexts and is associated with inadequate functioning. Symptoms can include anything from extreme passivity, devastation or helplessness when relationships end, avoidance of responsibilities and severe submission.People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions. They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions. This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour. These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone. When alone, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people. Generally people with DPD are also pessimistic: they expect the worst out of situations or believe that the worst will happen.

Glucokinase serves as the glucose sensor for thepancreatic beta cell. Normal glucokinase triggers insulin secretion as the glucose exceeds about 90 mg/dl (5 mM). These loss-of-function mutations result in a glucokinase molecule that is less sensitive or less responsive to rising levels of glucose. The beta cells in MODY 2 have a normal ability to make and secrete insulin, but do so only above an abnormally high threshold (e.g., 126144 mg/dl, or 7-8 mM). This produces a chronic, mildincrease in blood sugar, which is usually asymptomatic. It is usually detected by accidental discovery of mildly elevatedblood sugar(e.g., during pregnancy screening). An oralglucose tolerance testis much less abnormal than would be expected from theimpaired (elevated) fasting blood sugar, since insulin secretion is usually normal once the glucose has exceeded the threshold for that specific variant of the glucokinase enzyme.",

The primary defect in SAO differs significantly from other forms of elliptocytosis in that it is a defect in the gene coding for a protein that is not directly involved in the cytoskeleton scaffolding of the cell. Rather, the defect lies in a protein known as theband 3 protein, which lies in the cell membrane itself. The band 3 protein normally binds to another membrane-bound protein calledankyrin, but in SAO this bond is stronger than normal. Other abnormalities include tighter tethering of the band 3 protein to the cell membrane, increasedtyrosinephosphorylationof the band 3 protein, reducedsulfateaniontransport through the cell membrane, and more rapidATPconsumption.

The majority of individuals with SCS are moderately affected, with uneven facial features and a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw. In addition to the physical abnormalities, people with SCS also experience growth delays, which results in a relatively short stature.

The presentation in patients with classic CAH can be further subdivided into two forms: salt-wasting and simple-virilizing, depending on whether mineralocorticoid deficiency presents or absents, respectively.However, this subtyping is often not clinically meaningful because all patients lose salt to some degree, and clinical presentations may overlap.",

It is caused by avirusof thegenusOrbivirusbelonging to thefamilyReoviridae. This disease can be caused by any of the nine serotypes of this virus. AHS is not directlycontagious, but is known to be spread by insectvectors.AHS virus was first recorded south of the Sahara Desert in the mid-1600s, with the introduction of horses to southern Africa. The virus is considered endemic to the equatorial, eastern, and southern regions of Africa. Several outbreaks have occurred in the Equidae throughout Africa and elsewhere.AHS is known to beendemicinsub-Saharan Africa, and has spread toMorocco, theMiddle East,India, andPakistan. More recently, outbreaks have been reported in theIberian PeninsulaandThailand. AHS has never been reported in the Americas, eastern Asia, orAustralasia. Epidemiology is dependent on host-vector interaction, where cyclic disease outbreaks coincide with high numbers of competent vectors. The most important vector for AHS in endemic areas is thebiting midgeCulicoides imicola,  which prefers warm, humid conditions. Larvae do not carry the virus, and long, cold winters are sufficient to break epidemics in nonendemic areas.",

However, DRESS is often complicated by potentially life-threateninginflammationof internal organs and the syndrome has about a 10% mortality rate.Treatment consists of stopping the offending medication and providing supportive care. Systemiccorticosteroidsare commonly used as well but no controlled clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of this treatment.DRESS is classified as one form ofsevere cutaneous adverse reactions(SCARs). In addition to DRESS, SCARs includes four other drug-induced skin reactions, theStevensJohnson syndrome(SJS);Toxic epidermal necrolysis(TEN),StevensJohnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap syndrome(SJS/TEN); andAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis(AGEP).

The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000 live births worldwide.There is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated inThe Island of the ColorblindbyOliver Sacks, some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.",

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is associated with various types of medical implants.The clinical presentation varies according to the type of ALCL. Two of the ALCL subtypes are systemic lymphomas, in that they usually present with enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions of the body, or with tumors outside the lymph nodes (extranodal) such as bone, intestine, muscle, liver, or spleen.  These 2 subtypes usually associate with weight loss, fevers and night sweats, and can be lethal if left untreated without chemotherapy.The third type of ALCL is so-called cutaneous ALCL, and is a tumor that presents in the skin as ulcers that may persist, or occasionally mayinvolutespontaneously, and commonly recur. This type of ALCL usually manifests in different regions of the body and may extend to regional lymph nodes, i.e., an axillary lymph node if the ALCL presents in the arm.",

Affected individuals may be unable to form intimate attachments to others and simultaneously possess a rich and elaborate but exclusively internalfantasy world.Other associated features includestilted speech, alack of deriving enjoymentfrom most activities, feeling as though one is an \"observer\" rather than a participant in life, an inability to tolerate emotional expectations of others, apparent indifference when praised or criticized, a degree ofasexuality, and idiosyncratic moral or political beliefs.Symptoms typically start in late childhood or adolescence.The cause of SPD is uncertain, but there is some evidence of links and shared genetic risk between SPD, othercluster A personality disorders(such asschizotypal personality disorder) andschizophrenia. Thus, SPD is considered to be a \"schizophrenia-like personality disorder\".It is diagnosed by clinical observation, and it can be very difficult to distinguish SPD from other mental disorders (such asautism spectrum disorder, with which it may sometimes overlap).",

Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease,simple coal workers' pneumoconiosisandcomplicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis(orprogressive massive fibrosis, or PMF).More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust developindustrial bronchitis,clinically defined aschronic bronchitis(i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking.

The condition is sometimes referred to asfainting goat syndrome, as it is responsible for the eponymous 'fainting' seen infainting goatswhen presented with a sudden stimulus. Of note, myotonia congenita has no association with malignant hyperthermia (MH).The prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest. Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance. During a fall, a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over. However, a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence.

Research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality (fear) predicts toddlers' empathy-related response to distress. The findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues, the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress. If a child does not learn how to handle fear or distress the child will be more likely to lash out at other children. If the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills, the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder.",

The exceptions, people who have mutations in the gene for ferroportin, prove the rule: these people have plenty of hepcidin, but their cells lack the proper response to it.

This may occur in a number of settings, including obesity,polycystic ovary syndrome, estrogen producing tumours (e.g.granulosa cell tumour) and certain formulations ofestrogen replacement therapy. Endometrial hyperplasia is a significant risk factor for the development or even co-existence ofendometrial cancer, so careful monitoring and treatment of women with this disorder is essential.",

In case of a suspected outbreak it may be useful to keep track of dietary history, which is also useful for exclusion of differential diagnoses.Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection. Eggs appear in the feces first between 911 weeks post-infection. The cause of this is unknown, and it is also difficult to distinguish between the different species of fasciola as well distinguishing them fromechinostomesandFasciolopsis.Most immunodiagnostic tests detect infection with very high sensitivity, and as concentration drops after treatment, it is a very good diagnostic method.Clinically it is not possible to differentiate from otherliver and bile diseases.

Infants experience a high mean arterial pulmonary artery pressure and a high afterload at the right ventricle. This means that the heart is working against higher pressures, which makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.In a fetus, there is highpulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) and low pulmonary blood flow as the fetus does not use the lungs for oxygen transfer, but instead relies on the placenta for oxygen. When the baby is born, the lungs are needed for oxygen transfer and need high blood flow which is encouraged by low PVR. The failure of the circulatory system of the newborn to adapt to these changes by lowering PVR leads to persistent fetal circulation.The newborn is therefore born with elevated PVR, which leads topulmonary hypertension. Because of this, the condition is also widely known aspersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn(PPHN).This condition can be either acute or chronic, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization ofpurinesleads to high levels of uric acid production. This results in bothhigh levels of uric acid in the bloodandurine, associated with severegoutand kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderateintellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a particularly striking feature of LNS isself-mutilatingbehaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen inHuntington's disease.

Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behaviour. Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.TheDSM-5has re-classified the condition as an addictive disorder, with sufferers exhibiting many similarities to those who have substance addictions.\r\nThe termgambling addictionhas long been used in the recovery movement.Pathological gambling was long considered by theAmerican Psychiatric Associationto be animpulse control disorderrather than anaddiction.However, data suggest a closer relationship between pathological gambling and substance use disorders than exists between PG and obsessive-compulsive disorder, largely because the behaviors in problem gambling and most primary substance use disorders (i.e. those not resulting from a desire to \"self-medicate\" for another condition such as depression) seek to activate the brain's reward mechanisms while the behaviors characterizing obsessive-compulsive disorder are prompted by overactive and misplaced signals from the brain's fear mechanisms.",

Frontal lobe impairment can be detected by recognition of typical clinical signs, use of simple screening tests, and specialist neurological testing.The signs and symptoms of frontal lobe disorder can be indicated bydysexecutive syndromewhich consists of a number of symptoms which tend to occur together.Broadly speaking, these symptoms fall into three main categories; cognitive (movement and speech), emotional or behavioral. Although many of these symptoms regularly co-occur, it is common to encounter patients who have several, but not all of these symptoms. This is one reason why some researchers are beginning to argue that dysexecutive syndrome is not the best term to describe these various symptoms. The fact that many of the dysexecutive syndrome symptoms can occur alone has led some researchersto suggest that the symptoms should not be labelled as a \"syndrome\" as such.

Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known asosteitis fibrosa,osteodystrophia fibrosa, andvon Recklinghausen's disease of bone(not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease,neurofibromatosis type I), is caused byhyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus ofparathyroid hormonefrom over-activeparathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity ofosteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclasticbone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by aparathyroid adenoma,hereditaryfactors,parathyroid carcinoma, orrenal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, includingcalcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and includebone fractures,kidney stones,nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.First described in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected through a combination ofblood testing,X-rays, andtissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.",

Albinism can reduce the survivability of an animal; for example, it has been suggested that albino alligators have an average survival span of only 24 hours due to the lack of protection from UV radiation and their lack of camouflage to avoid predators.It is a common misconception that all albino animals have characteristic pink or red eyes (resulting from the lack of pigment in theirisallowing the blood vessels of the retina to be visible), however this is not the case for some forms of albinism.Familiar albino animals include in-bred strains oflaboratory animals(rats, mice and rabbits), but populations of naturally occurring albino animals exist in the wild, e.g.Mexican cave tetra.  Albinism is a well-recognized phenomenon in molluscs, both in the shell and in the soft parts.  It has been claimed by some, e.g.that \"albinism\" can occur for a number of reasons aside from inheritance, including genetic mutations, diet, living conditions, age, disease, or injury.  However, this is contrary to definitions where the condition is inherited.Oculocutaneous albinism(OCA) is a clearly defined set of seven types of genetic mutations which reduce or completely prevent the synthesis ofeumelaninorpheomelanin, resulting in reduced pigmentation.Type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1a) is the form most commonly recognised as 'albino' as this results in a complete absence of melanin in the skin, hair/fur/feathers, and pink pupils, however this has led many to assume that all albinos are pure white with pink pupils, which is not the case.",

       "disease_overview":"Glycogen storage disease type IVis a form ofglycogen storage disease, which is caused by aninborn error of metabolism. It is the result of a mutation in theGBE1gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but show no symptoms of the disease. It affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all Glycogen Storage Diseases being type IV.It is a result of the absence of theglycogen branching enzyme, which is critical in the production ofglycogen. This leads to very long unbranched glucose chains being stored in glycogen. The long unbranched molecules have a low solubility which leads to glycogen precipitation in the liver. These deposits subsequently build up in the body tissue, especially theheartandliver. The inability to breakdown glycogen in muscle cells causes muscle weakness. The probable end result is cirrhosis and death within 5 years. In adults, the activity of the enzyme is higher and symptoms do not appear until later in life.",

In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions necessary for bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides) occurs in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, likely contributing locally to cause matrix hypomineralization (osteomalacia).The most common cause of osteomalacia is adeficiency of vitamin D, which is normally derived from sunlight exposure and, to a lesser extent, from the diet.The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum25(OH)Dlevel.Less common causes of osteomalacia can include hereditary deficiencies of vitamin D or phosphate (which would typically be identified in childhood) or malignancy.",

The disorder is characterized by bruising,fatigue,anemia, lowblood plateletcount and enlargement of theliverandspleen, and is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzymeglucocerebrosidase(also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially inmacrophages(mononuclear leukocytes). Glucocerebroside can collect in thespleen,liver,kidneys,lungs,brain, andbone marrow.Manifestations may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction,skeletal disordersor bone lesions that may be painful, severeneurologicalcomplications, swelling oflymph nodesand (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin,anemia, low bloodplateletcount, and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.",

Seizures in nodding disease span a wide range of severity.NeurotoxicologistPeter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, \"one or two  will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod.

There is an ongoing discussion however the term chronic enteropathy might be a better term to use than Inflammatory bowel disease in dogs because it differs from IBD in humans in how the dogs respond to treatment. For example, many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD who often need immunosuppressive treatment. Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation that is occurring (lymfoplasmacytic, eosinophilic or granulomatous). In dogs, low levels of cobalamin in the blood have shown to be a risk factor for negative outcome.",

In some cases, the infection can then group around corneal nerves, producing radial deposits (radial keratoneuritis), and causing extreme pain. These are features also seen in viral andbacterial keratitis, and may be misleading.The organism is also capable of invading deeper into the cornea; usingmetalloproteasesit is able to penetrate deep into thestromaof the cornea.As the disease progresses, it may penetrate through cornea but very rarely causes infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) due to a robust neutrophil response in theanterior chamber.",

Patients with this disorder tend to have a hair shaft defect (trichorrhexis invaginata), also known as \"bamboo hair\". The disrupted skin barrier function in affected individuals also presents a high susceptibility toinfectionandallergy, leading to the development of scaly, reddish skin similar toatopic dermatitis.In severe cases, these atopic manifestations persist throughout the individual's life, and consequently post-natal mortality rates are high.

Bruxism is a common behavior; reports of prevalence range from 8% to 31% in the general population.Several symptoms are commonly associated with bruxism, including hypersensitive teeth, aching jaw muscles, headaches,tooth wear, and damage to dental restorations (e.g. crowns and fillings).Symptoms may be minimal, without patient awareness of the condition.There are two main types of bruxism: one occurs during sleep (nocturnal bruxism) and one during wakefulness (awake bruxism). Dental damage may be similar in both types, but the symptoms of sleep bruxism tend to be worse on waking and improve during the course of the day, and the symptoms of awake bruxism may not be present at all on waking, and then worsen over the day. The causes of bruxism are not completely understood, but probably involve multiple factors.Awake bruxism is more common in women, whereas men and women are affected in equal proportions by sleep bruxism.Awake bruxism is thought to have different causes from sleep bruxism.
