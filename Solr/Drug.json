Viomycin was the first member of the tuberactinomycins to be isolated and identified,and was used to treat TB until it was replaced by the less toxic, but structurally related compound,capreomycin.  The tuberactinomycins target bacterial ribosomes, binding RNA and disrupting bacterial protein synthesis and certain forms of RNA splicing.  Viomycin is produced by theactinomyceteStreptomyces puniceus.The gene cluster for viomycin has been sequenced fromStreptomyces sp.strain ATCC 11861,Streptomyces vinaceusand fromStreptomyces lividans1326.It consists of a central cyclic pentapeptide code assembled fromnonribosomal peptide synthetase(NRPS).  The NRPS contains 4 proteins: VioA, VioF, VioI, and VioG.  These proteins condense and cyclize two molecules ofL-2,3-diaminopropionate (L-Dap), two molecules ofL-serine (L-Ser), and one molecule of (2S,3R)-capreomycidine (L-Cam).

It is anaminesynthesized by removing acarboxyl groupfrom a molecule of itsprecursor chemicalL-DOPA, which issynthesizedin the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as aneurotransmittera chemical released byneurons(nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinctdopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component ofreward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,and manyaddictivedrugsincrease dopamine release or block itsreuptakeinto neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved inmotor controland in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways andcell groupsform a dopamine system which isneuromodulatory.In popular culture and media, dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confersmotivational salience;in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome."

It has a slightly salty,alkalinetaste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form isnahcolite. It is a component of the mineralnatronand is found dissolved in many mineral springs.Because it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such asbaking soda,bread soda,cooking soda, andbicarbonate of soda. The termbaking sodais more common in the United States, whereasbicarbonate of sodais more common in Australia and Britain.In colloquial usage, the names sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate of soda are often truncated; forms such as sodium bicarb, bicarb soda, bicarbonate, and bicarb are common."

This followed their discovery of erythromycin, another antibiotic.Cephamycin C was the firstcephemdiscovered but while it was highly resistant to a lot of beta-lactamases, as is its derivative cefoxitin, it was almost only effective against Gram negative bacteria.The scientists used chemistry to modify the compound, which gives cefoxitin the title of semi-synthetic since a biological product is altered to artificially synthesize it. This new modification broadened its spectrum to include Gram positive bacteria. More than 300 modifications were made to it and tested on the cephalosporin base with methoxy groups at the 7-alpha position.

Non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates are metabolized by osteoclasts to compounds that then replace a portion of theadenosine triphosphate(ATP) molecule, making it non-functional. These non-functional molecules then competitively inhibit ATP in the cell, reducing cell energy and leading toapoptosis.Decreased levels of osteoclasts subsequently reduce the degree of breakdown of bone and bone turnover.

On the other hand, usage of Amevive was associated with a certain risk of development systemic diseases such as malignancies. This drug was never approved for the European drug market.Alefacept is used to controlinflammationin moderate to severepsoriasiswith plaque formation, where it interferes withlymphocyteactivation.It is also being studied in the treatment ofcutaneous T-cell lymphomaandT-cellnon-Hodgkin lymphoma."

Chemically, it mimics thenucleosideadenosine. However, unlike adenosine it is relatively resistant to breakdown by the enzymeadenosine deaminase, which causes it to accumulate in cells and interfere with the cell's ability to process DNA. Cladribine is taken up by cells via a transporter. Once inside a cell cladribine is activated mostly in lymphocytes, when it is triphosphorylated by the enzymedeoxyadenosine kinase(dCK). Various phosphatases dephosphorylate cladribine. Activated, triphosphorylated, cladribine is incorporated into mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which triggers apoptosis.

Therefore, it is only effective in cancers with mutated and overactiveEGFR.  It is marketed byAstraZenecaandTeva.Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor ofepidermal growth factor receptor's (EGFR)tyrosine kinasedomain. Thus gefitinib is anEGFR inhibitor. The target protein (EGFR) is a member of a family of receptors (ErbB) which includes Her1(EGFR), Her2(erb-B2), Her3(erb-B3) and Her4 (Erb-B4).\r\nEGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of humancarcinomas- for example in lung and breast cancers. This leads to inappropriate activation of theanti-apoptotic Ras signalling cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Research on gefitinib-sensitivenon-small cell lung cancershas shown that a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is responsible for activating anti-apoptotic pathways.These mutations tend to confer increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Of the types of non-small cell lung cancer histologies,adenocarcinomais the type that most often harbors these mutations.

Under theConvention on Psychotropic Substances, it is a Schedule IV drug.It is no longer generally available in the United States as a result of theFood and Drug Administration(FDA) withdrawing approval of pemoline as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing pemoline for ADHD. This spurredAbbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit.Pemoline is generally considereddopaminergic, but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined.Pemoline passes thebloodbrain barrierand acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimalsympathomimeticside effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is anootropicacting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assistingRNAformation in the brain.

By blockingnicotinic acetylcholine receptors, imidacloprid preventsacetylcholinefromtransmittingimpulses between nerves, resulting in the insect's paralysis and eventual death. It is effective on contact and via stomach action.Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuronreceptorsthan to mammal neuron receptors, thisinsecticideis more toxic to insects than to mammals.As of 1999, imidacloprid was the most widely used insecticide in the world.Although it is now off patent, the primary manufacturer of this chemical is Bayer CropScience (part ofBayer AG). It is sold under many names for many uses; it can be applied by soil injection,tree injection, application to the skin of the plant, broadcast foliar, ground application as a granular or liquid formulation, or as a pesticide-coatedseed treatment.Imidacloprid is widely used for pest control in agriculture.

Disopyramide is available in both oral and intravenous forms, and has a low degree of toxicity.Disopyramide's Class 1a activity is similar to that ofquinidinein that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction.Disopyramide depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity.Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration.This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium.As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure."

Thienamycin has antibacterial activity, but is unstable in aqueous solution, so impractical to administer to patients.Imipenem has a broad spectrum of activity againstaerobicandanaerobic,Gram-positiveandGram-negativebacteria.It is particularly important for its activity againstPseudomonas aeruginosaand theEnterococcusspecies. It is not active againstMRSA, however."

As found with previous NSAIDs, nabumetone's active metabolite inhibits thecyclooxygenaseenzyme and preferentially blocksCOX-2activity (which is indirectly responsible for the production of inflammation and pain during arthritis). The active metabolite of nabumetone is felt to be the compound primarily responsible for therapeutic effect. Comparatively, the parent drug is a poor inhibitor of COX-2 byproducts, particularlyprostaglandins. It may be lessnephrotoxicthanindomethacin.There are two knownpolymorphsof the compound."

Evidence suggests that reduction of theblood pressureby 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, ofischaemic heart diseaseby 21%, and reduce the likelihood ofdementia,heart failure, andmortalityfromcardiovascular disease.There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means. Among the most important and most widely used medications arethiazidediuretics,calcium channel blockers,ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II receptor antagonists(ARBs), andbeta blockers.Which type of medication to use initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and resulting national guidelines. The fundamental goal of treatment should be the prevention of the importantendpointsof hypertension, such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered.The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost. The choice of more expensive agents, where cheaper ones would be equally effective, may have negative impacts on national healthcare budgets.As of 2018, the best availableevidencefavors low-dose thiazide diuretics as thefirst-line treatmentof choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary.Although clinical evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most people (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an ACE inhibitor is recommended byNICEin the UK for those under 55 years old."

Propafenone is more selective for cells with a high rate, but also blocks normal cells more than class Ia or Ib. Propafenone differs from the prototypical class Ic antiarrhythmic in that it has additional activity as a beta-adrenergic blocker which can causebradycardiaand bronchospasm."

The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients whose symptoms improved after six weeks of treatment. Vedolizumab was shown to be more effective than placebo: 47% (106 out of 225) of patients who received vedolizumab showed an improvement in symptoms, compared with 26% (38 out of 149) of patients who received placebo. The study also showed that vedolizumab maintained the effect up to 52 weeks more effectively than placebo.Moreover, vedolizumab treatment was shown to achieve higher percentage of clinical remissions (31.3% vs. 22.5%) in patients with ulcerative colitis in comparison toadalimumabtreatment."

Betaxolol also shows greater affinity for beta1receptors thanmetoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart, betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called theaqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to theoptic nerveand loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due toglaucoma.It was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1983."

    "overview_t": "Anantibody(Ab), also known as animmunoglobulin(Ig),is a large, Y-shapedproteinproduced mainly byplasma cellsthat is used by theimmune systemto neutralizepathogenssuch aspathogenic bacteriaandviruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called anantigen, via thefragment antigen-binding(Fab) variable region.Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains aparatope(analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particularepitope(analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody cantagamicrobeor an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activatemacrophagesto destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via itsFc region(located at the base of the \"Y\"), which contains a conservedglycosylationsite involved in these interactions.The production of antibodies is the main function of thehumoral immune system.Antibodies are secreted byB cellsof the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells calledplasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in theblood plasma, and amembrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as theB-cell receptor(BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories calledplasma cellsormemory B cellsthat will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.In most cases, interaction of the B cell with aT helper cellis necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.Soluble antibodies are released into thebloodand tissue fluids, as well as manysecretionsto continue to survey for invading microorganisms."

While zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, headache and stomach upset often occur. Some rare side effects can occur, which can be life-threatening, such asliver failure.Churg-Strausssyndrome has been associated with zafirlukast, but the relationship isn't thought to be causative in nature. Overdoses of zafirlukast tend to be self-limiting.Zafirlukast, like other LTRAs, works by inhibiting the immune system. Through its action on inflammatory cells in the lungs, zafirlukast reduces the production of inflammatory mediators that are implicated in the pathogenesis ofasthma. Zafirlukast is extensively hepatically metabolized by an enzyme calledCYP2C9. Zafirlukast inhibits the action ofCYP3A4, leading to drug-drug interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Genetic differences inLTC4 synthaseandCYP2C9may predict how a person reacts to zafirlukast treatment."

Sulindac is aprodrug, derived fromsulfinylindene, that is converted in the body to the active NSAID. More specifically, the agent is converted by liver enzymes to a sulfide that is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. This is thought to help maintain constant blood levels with reduced gastrointestinal side effects. Some studies have shown sulindac to be relatively less irritating to the stomach than other NSAIDs except for drugs of theCOX-2 inhibitorclass. The exact mechanism of its NSAID properties is unknown, but it is thought to act on enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, inhibitingprostaglandinsynthesis."
