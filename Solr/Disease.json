The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.There are two main types of amnesia:retrograde amnesiaandanterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from theshort-termstore into thelong-termstore. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to themedial temporal lobe. In addition, specific areas of thehippocampus(theCA1 region) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of thediencephalonare damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation betweendeficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice.In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recallimmediate informationis still retained,and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition,priming(both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of freshnon-declarativeknowledge.Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.",

These symptoms typically vary depending on the extent and, often more critically, on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord.Syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people,with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, ormyelopathy.",

This is followed by multiple changes in the filtration units of the kidneys, thenephrons. (There are normally about 750,0001.5 million nephrons in each adult kidney).Initially, there is constriction of theefferent arteriolesand dilation ofafferent arterioles, with resulting glomerular capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration; this gradually changes to hypofiltration over time.Concurrently, there are changes within the glomerulus itself: these include a thickening of thebasement membrane, a widening of the slit membranes of thepodocytes, an increase in the number of mesangial cells, and an increase in mesangial matrix. This matrix invades the glomerular capillaries and produces deposits called Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.

Aggressive Berger's disease (a rarer form of the disease) can attack other major organs, such as theliver,skinandheart.IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide; however, aggressive Berger's disease is on theNORDlist of rare diseases.Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of theIgAantibodyin the glomerulus. There are other diseases associated with glomerular IgA deposits, the most common beingIgA vasculitis(formerly known asHenochSchonlein purpura), which is considered by many to be a systemic form of IgA nephropathy.IgA vasculitis presents with a characteristicpurpuricskin rash,arthritis, and abdominal pain, and occurs more commonly in young adults (1635 years old). HSP is associated with a more benign prognosis than IgA nephropathy. In non-aggressive IgA nephropathy there is traditionally a slow progression to chronic kidney failure in 2530% of cases during a period of 20 years.",

Intracellular metabolism of cystine, as it happens with all amino acids, requires its transport across the cell membrane. After degradation ofendocytosedprotein to cystine within lysosomes, it is normally transported to thecytosol. But if there is a defect in the carrier protein, cystine is accumulated in lysosomes. As cystine is highly insoluble, when its concentration in tissue lysosomes increases, its solubility is immediately exceeded and crystalline precipitates are formed in almost all organs and tissues.",

When myoclonic jerks are occasionally associated with abnormal brain wave activity, it can be categorized as myoclonic seizure. If the abnormal brain wave activity is persistent and results from ongoing seizures, then a diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy may be considered.Myoclonuscan be described as brief jerks of the body;it can involve any part of the body, but it is mostly seen in limbs or facial muscles. The jerks are usually involuntary and can lead to falls.EEGis used to read brain wave activity. Spike activity produced from the brain is usually correlated with brief jerks seen onEMGor excessive muscle artifact. They usually occur without detectable loss of consciousness and may be generalized, regional or focal on the EEG tracing. Myoclonus jerks can be epileptic or not epileptic. Epileptic myoclonus is an elementary electroclinical manifestation of epilepsy involving descending neurons, whose spatial (spread) or temporal (self-sustained repetition) amplification can trigger overt epileptic activity.",

The white blood cells present within the transplanted tissue then attack the recipient's body's cells, which leads to GvHD. This should not be confused with atransplant rejection, which occurs when the immune system of the transplant recipient rejects the transplanted tissue; GvHD occurs when the donor's immune system's white blood cells reject the recipient.

This leads to ahypoplastic(undersized) or absentright ventricle. \r\nThis defect is contracted during prenatal development, when the heart does not finish developing. It causes the heart to be unable to properly oxygenate the rest of the blood in the body. Because of this, the body does not have enough oxygen to live, so other defects must occur to maintain blood flow.\r\nBecause of the lack of an A-V connection, anatrial septal defect(ASD) must be present to fill the left ventricle with blood. Also, since there is a lack of a right ventricle there must be a way to pump blood into thepulmonary arteries, and this is accomplished by aventricular septal defect(VSD).\r\nThe causes of Tricupsid atresia are unknown.An atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD) must both be present to maintain blood flow-from the right atrium, the blood must flow through the ASD to the left atrium to the left ventricle and through the VSD to the right ventricle to allow access to the lungs",

Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction ofaction potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate out of control in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve. Schwannomas on sensory nerve axons cause chronic severe pain. Treatment options for schwannomas are to surgically remove them, have radiation, cyberknife or Intracapsular Enucleation. Previous designations for schwannomas include neurinoma and neurilemmoma.",

In general, foods and drinks with apHbelow 5.05.7 have been known to trigger dental erosion effects.Numerous clinical and laboratory reports link erosion to excessive consumption of drinks. Those thought to pose a risk are soft drinks, some alcohol and fruit drinks, fruit juices such asorange juice(which containcitric acid) andcarbonated drinkssuch ascolas(in which thecarbonic acidis not the cause of erosion, but citric andphosphoric acid).Additionally,winehas been shown to erode teeth, with the pH of wine as low as 3.03.8.Other possible sources of erosive acids are from exposure tochlorinatedswimming poolwater,and regurgitation ofgastric acids.In children with chronic diseases, the use of medicines with acid components is a risk factor too.Dental erosion has also been recorded in the fossil record and was likely caused by the consumption of acidic fruits or plants.",

Three variants are known to exist, FAP andattenuated FAP(originally calledhereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused byAPC genedefects on chromosome 5 whileautosomal recessive FAP(orMUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in theMUTYHgene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal beforemetastasisoutside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer.The root cause of FAP is understood to be agenetic mutationa change in the body'stumour suppressor genesthat prevent development of tumours. The change allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually reach the end of their life; inevitably one or more will eventually progress and give rise tocancer(7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). These gene changes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's ability to prevent cells from becoming cancerous. Even with the gene change, it may still take time before a cell actually does develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.",

Symptoms typically begin in early childhood and become noticeable in the teenage years, with 95% of affected individuals manifesting disease by age 20 years. Non-muscular manifestations of FSHD includehearing lossand blood vessel abnormalities in theback of the eye.FSHD is caused by complex genetic changes involving theDUX4gene.In those without FSHD,DUX4is expressed (ie: turned on) in early human development and later repressed (ie: turned off) in mature tissues.In FSHD,DUX4is inadequately turned off, which can be caused by several different mutations, the most common being deletion of DNA in the region surroundingDUX4.This mutation is termed \"D4Z4 contraction\" and defines FSHD type 1 (FSHD1), making up 95% of FSHD cases. FSHD due to other mutations is classified as FSHD type 2 (FSHD2). Regardless of which mutation is present, disease can only result if the individual has a 4qA allele, which is a common variation in the DNA next toDUX4.Up to 30% of FSHD cases are due to a new mutation, which then is able to be passed on to children. FSHD1 follows anautosomal dominantinheritance pattern, meaning each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of also being affected.HowDUX4expression causes muscle damage is unclear.Expression ofDUX4gene produces DUX4 protein, whose function is to modulate hundreds of other genes, many of which are involved in muscle function.Diagnosis is bygenetic testing.",

Type 1 diabetes only occurs when pancreatic beta-cell function is impaired. Hyperinsulinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions includingdiabetes mellitus type 2, in neonates and in drug-induced hyperinsulinemia. It can also occur in congenital hyperinsulinism, includingnesidioblastosis.Hyperinsulinemia is associated withhypertension,obesity,dyslipidemia, andglucose intolerance.These conditions are collectively known asMetabolic syndrome.This close association between hyperinsulinemia and conditions of metabolic syndrome suggest related or common mechanisms of pathogenicity.Hyperinsulinemia has been shown to \"play a role in obesehypertensionby increasing renal sodium retention\".",

These attacks were triggered by exercise or other forms of exertion and relieved by rest andnitroglycerin. In 1959, Dr.Myron Prinzmetaldescribed a type of angina that differed from the classic cases of Heberden angina in that it commonly occurred in the absence of exercise or exertion. Indeed, it often woke sufferers from their normal sleep. This variant angina differed from the classical angina described by Dr. Heberden in that it appeared due to episodicvasospasmof coronary arteries that were typically not occluded by pathological processes such asatherosclerosis,emboli, orspontaneous dissection(i.e. tears in the walls of coronary arteries).Variant angina had been described twice in the 1930s by other authorsand was referred to ascardiac syndrome X(CSX) by Kemp in 1973, in reference to patients with exercise-induced angina who nonetheless had normal coronary angiograms.CSX is now termedmicrovascular angina, i.e. angina caused by disease of the heart's small arteries.",

Also known as \"combat fatigue\" or \"battle neurosis\", it has some overlap with the diagnosis ofacute stress reactionused in civilianpsychiatry. It is historically linked toshell shockand can sometimes precursepost-traumatic stress disorder.Combat stress reaction is an acute reaction that includes a range of behaviors resulting from the stress of battle that decrease the combatant's fighting efficiency. The most common symptoms are fatigue, slower reaction times, indecision, disconnection from one's surroundings, and the inability to prioritize. Combat stress reaction is generally short-term and should not be confused withacute stress disorder,post-traumatic stress disorder, or other long-term disorders attributable to combat stress, although any of these may commence as a combat stress reaction. The US Army uses the term/acronym COSR (Combat Stress Reaction) in official medical reports. This term can be applied to any stress reaction in the military unit environment. Many reactions look like symptoms of mental illness (such as panic, extreme anxiety, depression, and hallucinations), but they are only transient reactions to the traumatic stress of combat and the cumulative stresses of military operations.",

They may take relatively benign forms such asatrial fibrillation, leading to symptoms ofpalpitations,breathlessness, orfatigue.Accordingly, atrial fibrillation presenting in a newborn should raise the suspicion of short QT syndrome.In addition, far more dangerous heart rhythm disturbances such asventricular fibrillationcan also occur in those with short QT syndrome, leading toblackoutsor evensudden death.More than a third of those with short QT present with ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, while one in five cases are detected during family screening, and one in five cases are found incidentally after anelectrocardiogram(ECG) has been recorded for another reason.",

The condition can be inherited, but it is also encountered afterthyroidorparathyroid gland surgery, and it can be caused byimmune system-related damageas well as a number of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made withblood tests, and other investigations such asgenetic testingdepending on the results. The primary treatment of hypoparathyroidism is calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Calcium replacement orvitamin Dcan ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk ofkidney stonesandchronic kidney disease.However teriparatide, brand nameForteo, a biosimilar peptide to parathyroid hormone, may be given by injection.The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are the result of thelow blood calcium level, which interferes with normalmuscle contractionandnerve conduction. As a result, people with hypoparathyroidism can experienceparesthesia, an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet, as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as \"tetany\" that affect the hands and feet.Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such asfatigue,headaches,bone painandinsomnia.Crampyabdominal painmay occur.Physical examinationof someone withhypocalcemiamay show tetany, but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on thefacial nerve(a phenomenon known asChvostek's sign) or by using the cuff of asphygmomanometerto temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm (a phenomenon known asTrousseau's sign of latent tetany).",

It is asquamous cell carcinomaof an undifferentiated type.Squamous epithelial cellsare a flat type of cell found in the skin and the membranes that line some body cavities. Differentiation means how different the cancer cells are from normal cells.Undifferentiated cellsare cells that do not have their mature features or functionsNPC may present as a lump or a mass on both sides towards the back of the neck. These lumps usually are not tender or painful but appear as a result of the metastatic spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes, thus causing the lymph nodes to swell. Lymph nodes are defined as glands that function as part of the immune system and can be found throughout the body.Swelling of the lymph nodesin the neck is the initial presentation in many people, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph nodebiopsy. Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer may appear as headaches, a sore throat, and trouble hearing, breathing, or speaking.Additional symptoms of NPC include facial pain or numbness, blurred or double vision, trouble opening the mouth, or recurring ear infections. If the ear infection does not present with an upper respiratory tract infection, then an examination should be done on the nasopharynx. This is due to the fact that, in adults, ear infections are less common than in children.Signs and symptoms related to the primary tumor includetrismus, pain,otitis media,nasal regurgitationdue toparesis(loss of or impaired movement) of thesoft palate,hearing lossandcranial nerve palsy(paralysis). Larger growths may producenasal obstructionorbleedingand a \"nasal twang\".Metastatic spreadmay result in bone pain or organ dysfunction. Rarely, aparaneoplastic syndromeofosteoarthropathy(diseases of joints and bones) may occur with widespread disease.",

In years in which conditions  are favorable for the disease, the number of equine cases is over 200.Diagnosing equine encephalitis is challenging because many of the symptoms are shared with other illnesses and patients can be asymptomatic. Confirmations may require a sample of cerebral spinal fluid or brain tissue, although CT scans and MRI scans are used to detect encephalitis.

Bertina under the direction of (and in the laboratory of) Prof P. Reitsma.Despite the increased risk of VTE, people with one copy of this gene have not been found to have shorter lives than the general population.The symptoms of factor V Leiden vary among individuals. There are some individuals who have the F5 gene and who never develop thrombosis, while others have recurring thrombosis before the age of 30 years. This variability is influenced by the number of F5 gene mutations a person has, the presence of other gene alterations related to blood clotting, and circumstantial risk factors, such as surgery, use of oral contraceptives and pregnancy.",

The tumors generally begin in layers of connective tissue such as that under the skin, between muscles, and surrounding organs, and will generally start as a small lump with inflammation that grows. At first the lump will be self-contained as the tumor exists in its stage 1 state, and will not necessarily expand beyond its encapsulated form. However, it may develop cancerous processes that can only be detected through microscopic examination. As such, at this level the tumor is usually treated by excision that includes wide margins of healthy-looking tissue, followed by thorough biopsy and additional excision if necessary. The prognosis for a stage 1 tumor excision is usually fairly positive, but if the tumors progress to levels 2 and 3, prognosis is worse because tumor cells have likely spread to other locations. These locations can either be nearby tissues or system-wide locations that include the lungs, kidneys, and liver. In these cases prognosis is grim andchemotherapyandradiationare the only methods of controlling the cancer.Spindle cell sarcoma can develop for a variety of reasons, including genetic predisposition but it also may be caused by a combination of other factors including injury and inflammation in patients that are already thought to be predisposed to such tumors. Spindle cells are a naturally occurring part of the body's response to injury. In response to an injury, infection, or other immune response the connective tissues will begin dividing to heal the affected area, and if the tissue is predisposed to spindle cell cancer the high cellular turnover may result in a few becoming cancerous and forming a tumor.",

They are due to the development of abnormalcellsthat have the ability to invade orspreadto other parts of the body.There are three main types of skin cancers:basal-cell skin cancer(BCC),squamous-cell skin cancer(SCC) andmelanoma.The first two, along with a number of less common skin cancers, are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.It often appears as a painless raised area of skin that may be shiny withsmall blood vessels running over itor may present as a raised area with anulcer.Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread.It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer.Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include amolethat has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds.More than 90% of cases are caused by exposure toultraviolet radiationfrom theSun.This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer.Exposure has increased, partly due to a thinnerozone layer.Tanning bedsare another common source of ultraviolet radiation.For melanomas and basal-cell cancers, exposure during childhood is particularly harmful.For squamous-cell skin cancers, total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important.Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles.People with lighter skin are at higher riskas are those with poor immune function such as from medications orHIV/AIDS.Diagnosis is bybiopsy.",

They are also known asosteochondromas. Additional sites of occurrence include on flat bones such as the pelvic bone and scapula. The distribution and number of these exostoses show a wide diversity among affected individuals.  Exostoses usually present during childhood.

The incidence of hereditary multiple exostoses is around  1 in 50,000 individuals.Hereditary multiple osteochondromas is the preferred term used by theWorld Health Organization.A noticeable lump in relation to an extremity may be the first presenting symptom. Multiple deformities can arise, namely coronal plane deformities around the knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. For example, genu valgum (knock knees), ankle valgus, ulnar bowing and shortening, and radial head subluxation are encountered. The majority of affected individuals have clinically manifest osteochondromas around the knee. Forearm involvement in  HMO is considerable.Furthermore, short stature may occur and is generally disproportionate. Such manifestations usually result from disruption of physeal growth especially that osteochondromas typically arise at the metaphyseal ends of long bones in close proximity to the physis.Intra-articular osteochondromas of the hip can induce  limitation of range of motion, joint pain and acetabular dysplasia.Likewise joint pain at other locations and neurovascular compression can occur.

The symptoms of vibration white finger are the vascular component of HAVS.HAVS is a widespread recognized industrial disease affecting tens of thousands of workers. It is a disorder that affects the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and joints of the hand, wrist, and arm. Its best known effect is vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a term introduced by the Industrial Injury Advisory Council in 1970. Injury can occur at frequencies between 5 and 2000 Hz but the greatest risk for fingers is between 50 and 300 Hz. The total risk exposure for hand and arm is calculated by the use of ISO 5349-1, which stipulates maximum damage between 8 and 16 Hz and a rapidly declining risk at higher frequencies. The ISO 5349-1 frequency risk assessment has been criticized as corresponding poorly to observational data; more recent research suggests that medium and high frequency vibrations also increase HAVS risk.",

The infection is usually treated with cutting or shaving of the hair and followed by the application of anti-fungal andtopical agents. The fungus is used for cosmetic purposes to darken hair in some societies as a symbol of attractiveness.When grown on agar at 25 C (77 F)Piedraia hortaegrows very slowlyto form black-greenish, limited and pointed colonies.Piedraia hortaetaken from infected hairs have dark brown nodules,which are made up of ascostroma.

Microscopically,P. hortaeproduces short, darkhyphaecontainingthick-walled resting cells. Theascomataconsist of irregularly shaped pseudothecia that are black in colour. Each ascoma contains a singleascuscontaining eight ascospores.Theascosporesare dark, curved and become very narrow at the ends forming whip-like appendages.Affected hairs develop stone-like black nodules affixed to the hair shaft that cause weakness of the hair. Infected hairs treated withpotassium hydroxidefluoresce underultraviolet lightdespite that the fungus itself does not normally fluoresce. Fluorescence of the piedra indicates secondary contamination by bacteria.Identification is easily achieved by microscopic examination of the hair nodules, and can be confirmed by sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomalinternal transcribed spacerregion.",

Improvements have been made with techniques such as pituitaryradiation therapy, ACTH assay,transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, higher resolutionMRIs, and sampling of theinferior petrosal sinus.

    "overview_t": "Ollier diseaseis a rare sporadic nonhereditary skeletal disorder in which typically benign cartilaginous tumors (enchondromas) develop near the growth plate cartilage. This is caused by cartilage rests that grow and reside within themetaphysisordiaphysisand eventually mineralize over time to form multiple enchondromas.Key signs of the disorder include asymmetry and shortening of the limb as well as an increased thickness of the bone margin. These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age.Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bonesarcomasthat necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm. Cases in patients with Ollier disease has shown a link to IDH1, IDH2, and PTH1R gene mutations. Currently, there are no forms of treatment for the underlying condition of Ollier disease but complications such as fractures, deformities, malignancies that arise from it can be treated through surgical procedures. The prevalence of this condition is estimated at around 1 in 100,000.It is unclear whether the men or women are more affected by this disorder due to conflicting case studies.The disease consists of the growth multipleenchondromaswhich usually develop in early childhood. The growth of these enchondromas usually stops after skeletal maturation.The affected extremity is shortened (asymmetric dwarfism) and sometimes bowed due to epiphyseal fusion anomalies. Bone lesions generally present as cellular during childhood and become more solitary over time. People with Ollier disease are prone to breaking bones(fractures)and normally have swollen, aching limbs. However, many cases of solitary enchondromata go unnoticed due to lack of symptoms. Enchondromas are commonly found in the phalanges, metacarpal, and metatarsal bones in patients of Ollier disease due to the affinity of enchondromas to long tubular bones such as the femur and humerus. A unilateral distribution of bone lesions is usually observed but bilateral distributions or a singular extremity can occur as well. Approximately a third of the cases show some form of physical deformities of bowing or abnormal limb lengthening.",

Venous thrombosis leads to congestion of the affected part of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemiaandnecrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as anembolism. This type of embolism is known as athromboembolism. Complications can arise when avenous thromboembolism(commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as apulmonary embolism.

    "overview_t": "Perinatal asphyxia(also known asneonatal asphyxiaorbirth asphyxia) is the medical condition resulting from deprivation of oxygen to a newborn infant that lasts long enough during the birth process to cause physical harm, usually to the brain. It is also the inability to establish and sustain adequate or spontaneous respiration upon delivery of the newborn. It remains a serious condition which causes significant mortality and morbidity. It is an emergency condition and requires adequate and quick resuscitation measures.Perinatal asphyxia is also an oxygen deficit from the 28th week of gestation to the first seven days following delivery. It is also an insult to the fetus or newborn due to lack of oxygen or lack of perfusion to various organs and may be associated with a lack of ventilation. In accordance with WHO, perinatal asphyxia is characterised by-                                   Profound metabolic acidosis, with a PH <7.20 on umbilical cord arterial blood sample, Persistence of an APGAR score of 3 at the 5th minute,                                                           Clinical neurologic sequelae in the immediate neonatal period,Evidence  of multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs (heart,lungs,liver,gut,kidneys), butbrain damageis of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal. In more pronounced cases, an infant will survive, but with damage to the brain manifested as either mental, such asdevelopmental delayorintellectual disability, or physical, such asspasticity.It results most commonly from antepartum causes like a drop in maternalblood pressureor some other substantial interference with blood flow to the infant'sbrainduringdelivery. This can occur due to inadequatecirculationorperfusion, impaired respiratory effort, or inadequateventilation. Perinatal asphyxia happens in 2 to 10 per 1000 newborns that are born at term, and more for those that are born prematurely.WHO estimates that 4 million neonatal deaths occur yearly due to birth asphyxia, representing 38% of deaths of children under 5 years of age.",

Hence, personality disorders are defined by experiences and behaviors that differ fromsocial normsand expectations.

A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7mmol/l(100126mg/dl) (American Diabetes Associationguidelines) is considered slightly hyperglycemic, and above 7mmol/l(126mg/dl) is generally held to havediabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too hyperglycemic can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person'srenal threshold of glucoseand overall glucose tolerance. On average, however, chronic levels above 1012 mmol/L (180216 mg/dl) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.The degree of hyperglycemia can change over time depending on the metabolic cause, for example, impaired glucose tolerance or fasting glucose, and it can depend on treatment.Temporary hyperglycemia is often benign and asymptomatic. Blood glucose levels can rise well above normal and cause pathological and functional changes for significant periods without producing any permanent effects or symptoms.During this asymptomatic period, an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism can occur which can be tested by measuring plasma glucose.Chronic hyperglycemia at above normal levels can produce a very wide variety of serious complications over a period of years, including kidney damage, neurological damage, cardiovascular damage,damage to the retinaor damage to feet and legs.Diabetic neuropathymay be a result of long-term hyperglycemia.

    "overview_t": "Cognitive disorders (CDs), also known asneurocognitive disorders (NCDs), are a category ofmental health disordersthat primarily affect cognitive abilities including learning, memory, perception, and problem solving. Neurocognitive disorders includedeliriumand mild and major neurocognitive disorder (previously known asdementia). They are defined by deficits in cognitive ability that are acquired (as opposed to developmental), typically represent decline, and may have an underlying brain pathology.The DSM-5 defines six key domains of cognitive function:executive function, learning and memory, perceptual-motor function,language, complex attention, andsocial cognition.Although Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of cases of neurocognitive disorders, there are various medical conditions that affect mental functions such as memory, thinking, and the ability to reason, including frontotemporal degeneration, Huntingtons disease, Lewy body disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Parkinsons disease, prion disease, and dementia/neurocognitive issues due to HIV infection.Neurocognitive disorders are diagnosed as mild and major based on the severity of their symptoms. Whileanxiety disorders,mood disorders, andpsychotic disorderscan also have an effect on cognitive and memory functions, theDSM-IV-TRdoes not consider these cognitive disorders, because loss of cognitive function is not the primary (causal) symptom.Additionally, developmental disorders such asautism spectrum disorderare typically developed at birth or early in life as opposed to the acquired nature of neurocognitive disorders.",

    "overview_t": "Fluoride toxicityis a condition in which there are elevated levels of thefluorideionin the body. Although fluoride is safe for dental health at low concentrations, sustained consumption of large amounts of solublefluoridesaltsis dangerous.  Referring to a common salt of fluoride,sodium fluoride(NaF), the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).Ingestion of fluoride can producegastrointestinaldiscomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.20.3 mg/kg or 10 to 15 mg for a 50 kg person) than lethal doses.Although it is helpful topically for dental health in low dosage, chronic ingestion of fluoride in large amounts interferes with bone formation. In this way, the most widespread examples of fluoride poisoning arise from consumption of ground water that is abnormally fluoride-rich.For optimal dental health, theWorld Health Organizationrecommends a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L (milligrams per liter), depending on climate.Fluorosis becomes possible above this recommended dosage.  As of 2015, theUnited States Health and Human Services Departmentrecommends a maximum of 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water  updating and replacing the previous recommended range of 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams issued in 1962. The new recommended level is intended to reduce the occurrence of dental fluorosis while maintaining water fluoridation.",

Shear is also a cause, as it can pull on blood vessels that feed the skin. Pressure ulcers most commonly develop in individuals who are not moving about, such as those who are on chronic bedrest or consistently use a wheelchair. It is widely believed that other factors can influence the tolerance of skin for pressure and shear, thereby increasing the risk of pressure ulcer development. These factors areprotein-calorie malnutrition,microclimate(skin wetness caused by sweating orincontinence), diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such asarteriosclerosis, or diseases that reduce the sensation in the skin, such asparalysisorneuropathy.

The primary defect in SAO differs significantly from other forms of elliptocytosis in that it is a defect in the gene coding for a protein that is not directly involved in the cytoskeleton scaffolding of the cell. Rather, the defect lies in a protein known as theband 3 protein, which lies in the cell membrane itself. The band 3 protein normally binds to another membrane-bound protein calledankyrin, but in SAO this bond is stronger than normal. Other abnormalities include tighter tethering of the band 3 protein to the cell membrane, increasedtyrosinephosphorylationof the band 3 protein, reducedsulfateaniontransport through the cell membrane, and more rapidATPconsumption. These (and probably other) consequences of the SAO mutations lead to the following erythrocyte abnormalities:",

The presentation in patients with classic CAH can be further subdivided into two forms: salt-wasting and simple-virilizing, depending on whether mineralocorticoid deficiency presents or absents, respectively.However, this subtyping is often not clinically meaningful because all patients lose salt to some degree, and clinical presentations may overlap.",

It is caused by avirusof thegenusOrbivirusbelonging to thefamilyReoviridae. This disease can be caused by any of the nine serotypes of this virus. AHS is not directlycontagious, but is known to be spread by insectvectors.AHS virus was first recorded south of the Sahara Desert in the mid-1600s, with the introduction of horses to southern Africa. The virus is considered endemic to the equatorial, eastern, and southern regions of Africa. Several outbreaks have occurred in the Equidae throughout Africa and elsewhere.AHS is known to beendemicinsub-Saharan Africa, and has spread toMorocco, theMiddle East,India, andPakistan. More recently, outbreaks have been reported in theIberian PeninsulaandThailand. AHS has never been reported in the Americas, eastern Asia, orAustralasia. Epidemiology is dependent on host-vector interaction, where cyclic disease outbreaks coincide with high numbers of competent vectors. The most important vector for AHS in endemic areas is thebiting midgeCulicoides imicola,  which prefers warm, humid conditions. Larvae do not carry the virus, and long, cold winters are sufficient to break epidemics in nonendemic areas.",

With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.",

This is often asymptomatic and is found to at least some extent in all urban dwellersdue to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to large amounts of coal dust can result in more serious forms of the disease,simple coal workers' pneumoconiosisandcomplicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis(orprogressive massive fibrosis, or PMF).More commonly, workers exposed to coal dust developindustrial bronchitis,clinically defined aschronic bronchitis(i.e. productive cough for 3 months per year for at least 2 years) associated with workplace dust exposure. The incidence of industrial bronchitis varies with age, job, exposure, and smoking. In nonsmokers (who are less prone to develop bronchitis than smokers), studies of coal miners have shown a 16%to 17%incidence of industrial bronchitis.",

Of note, myotonia congenita has no association with malignant hyperthermia (MH).The prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest.

This means that the heart is working against higher pressures, which makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.In a fetus, there is highpulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) and low pulmonary blood flow as the fetus does not use the lungs for oxygen transfer, but instead relies on the placenta for oxygen. When the baby is born, the lungs are needed for oxygen transfer and need high blood flow which is encouraged by low PVR. The failure of the circulatory system of the newborn to adapt to these changes by lowering PVR leads to persistent fetal circulation.The newborn is therefore born with elevated PVR, which leads topulmonary hypertension. Because of this, the condition is also widely known aspersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn(PPHN).This condition can be either acute or chronic, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

Deep in the abscess,anaerobic bacteriacan flourish. When the abscess wall ruptures internally, the drainage carrying bacteria seeps through the soft tissue and infects the nearby structures. Spread of infection to the nearby internal jugular vein provides a gateway for the spread of bacteria through the bloodstream.

This deficiency occurs due tomutationsin theHPRT1genelocated on theX chromosome. LNS affects about 1 in 380,000 live births.The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by American medical studentMichael Leschand his mentor, pediatricianWilliam Nyhan, atJohns Hopkins.The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up ofuric acidin all body fluids. The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization ofpurinesleads to high levels of uric acid production. This results in bothhigh levels of uric acid in the bloodandurine, associated with severegoutand kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderateintellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a particularly striking feature of LNS isself-mutilatingbehaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen inHuntington's disease. Thecauseof the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGPRT causes the body to poorly utilizevitamin B12, some males may developmegaloblastic anemia.",

These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 1525% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).",

Although many of these symptoms regularly co-occur, it is common to encounter patients who have several, but not all of these symptoms. This is one reason why some researchers are beginning to argue that dysexecutive syndrome is not the best term to describe these various symptoms. The fact that many of the dysexecutive syndrome symptoms can occur alone has led some researchersto suggest that the symptoms should not be labelled as a \"syndrome\" as such.

It occurs in warm weather.People can get infected withBabesiaparasites by the bite of an infected tick, by getting a blood transfusion from an infected donor of blood products, or by congenital transmission (an infected mother to her baby).Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such asLyme disease.Aftertrypanosomes,Babesiais thought to be the second-most common bloodparasiteof mammals. They can have major adverse effects on the health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters.  In cattle the disease is known asTexas cattle feverorredwater.Half of all children and a quarter of previously healthy adults withBabesiainfection are asymptomatic. When people do develop symptoms, the most common are fever andhemolytic anemia, symptoms that are similar to those of malaria.People with symptoms usually become ill 1 to 4 weeks after the bite, or 1 to 9 weeks after transfusion of contaminated blood products. A person infected with babesiosis gradually developsmalaiseand fatigue, followed by a fever. Hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the blood, also develops. Chills, sweats, andthrombocytopeniaare also common symptoms. Symptoms may last from several days to several months.",

Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known asosteitis fibrosa,osteodystrophia fibrosa, andvon Recklinghausen's disease of bone(not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease,neurofibromatosis type I), is caused byhyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus ofparathyroid hormonefrom over-activeparathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity ofosteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclasticbone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by aparathyroid adenoma,hereditaryfactors,parathyroid carcinoma, orrenal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, includingcalcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and includebone fractures,kidney stones,nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.First described in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected through a combination ofblood testing,X-rays, andtissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.",

Albinism can reduce the survivability of an animal; for example, it has been suggested that albino alligators have an average survival span of only 24 hours due to the lack of protection from UV radiation and their lack of camouflage to avoid predators.It is a common misconception that all albino animals have characteristic pink or red eyes (resulting from the lack of pigment in theirisallowing the blood vessels of the retina to be visible), however this is not the case for some forms of albinism.Familiar albino animals include in-bred strains oflaboratory animals(rats, mice and rabbits), but populations of naturally occurring albino animals exist in the wild, e.g.Mexican cave tetra.  Albinism is a well-recognized phenomenon in molluscs, both in the shell and in the soft parts.  It has been claimed by some, e.g.that \"albinism\" can occur for a number of reasons aside from inheritance, including genetic mutations, diet, living conditions, age, disease, or injury.  However, this is contrary to definitions where the condition is inherited.Oculocutaneous albinism(OCA) is a clearly defined set of seven types of genetic mutations which reduce or completely prevent the synthesis ofeumelaninorpheomelanin, resulting in reduced pigmentation.Type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1a) is the form most commonly recognised as 'albino' as this results in a complete absence of melanin in the skin, hair/fur/feathers, and pink pupils, however this has led many to assume that all albinos are pure white with pink pupils, which is not the case.",

    "overview_t": "Glycogen storage disease type IVis a form ofglycogen storage disease, which is caused by aninborn error of metabolism. It is the result of a mutation in theGBE1gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but show no symptoms of the disease. It affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all Glycogen Storage Diseases being type IV.It is a result of the absence of theglycogen branching enzyme, which is critical in the production ofglycogen. This leads to very long unbranched glucose chains being stored in glycogen. The long unbranched molecules have a low solubility which leads to glycogen precipitation in the liver. These deposits subsequently build up in the body tissue, especially theheartandliver. The inability to breakdown glycogen in muscle cells causes muscle weakness. The probable end result is cirrhosis and death within 5 years. In adults, the activity of the enzyme is higher and symptoms do not appear until later in life.",

These villi grow in clusters that resemble grapes.A molar pregnancy can develop when a fertilized egg does not contain an original maternal nucleus. The products of conception may or may not contain fetal tissue. It is characterized by the presence of a hydatidiform mole (or hydatid mole, mola hydatidosa).Molar pregnancies are categorized as partial moles or complete moles, with the wordmolebeing used to denote simply a clump of growing tissue, or agrowth.A complete mole is caused by a single sperm (90% of the time) or two (10% of the time) sperm combining with an egg which has lost itsDNA. In the first case, the sperm then reduplicates, forming a \"complete\" 46chromosomeset.Thegenotypeis typically 46,XX (diploid) due to the subsequentmitosisof the fertilizing sperm but can also be 46,XY (diploid).46,YY (diploid) is not observed. In contrast, a partial mole occurs when a normal egg is fertilized by one or two sperm which then reduplicates itself, yielding the genotypes of 69,XXY (triploid) or 92,XXXY (tetraploid).",

In these cases, the symptoms are often severe enough to result in functional blindness. The person's eyelids feel like they are clamping shut and will not open without great effort. People have normal eyes, but for periods of time are effectively blind due to their inability to open their eyelids. In contrast, the reflex blepharospasm is due to any pain in and around the eye.It is of two types: essential and reflex blepharospasm.

Seizures in nodding disease span a wide range of severity.NeurotoxicologistPeter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, \"one or two  will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod.

For example, many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD who often need immunosuppressive treatment. Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation that is occurring (lymfoplasmacytic, eosinophilic or granulomatous).
