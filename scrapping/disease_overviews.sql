However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming rawegg whitesover a period of months to years. Egg whites contain high levels ofavidin, a protein that binds biotin strongly. When cooked, avidin is partiallydenaturedand binding to biotin is reduced. However one study showed that 30-40% of the avidin activity was still present in the white after frying or boiling.However, cooked egg whites are safer to consume.Genetic disorders such asbiotinidase deficiency,multiple carboxylase deficiency, andholocarboxylase synthetase deficiencycan also lead to inborn or late-onset forms of biotin deficiency.In all cases  dietary, genetic, or otherwise  supplementation withbiotinis the primary method of treatment.Biotin is a coenzyme for fivecarboxylasesin the human body (propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and 2 forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.) Therefore, biotin is essential for amino acidcatabolism,gluconeogenesis, andfatty acid metabolism.Biotinis also necessary for gene stability because it is covalently attached tohistones. Biotinylated histones play a role in repression oftransposable elementsand some genes.Normally, the amount of biotin in the body is regulated by dietary intake, biotin transporters (monocarboxylate transporter 1 and sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter), peptidyl hydrolasebiotinidase(BTD), and the protein ligase holocarboxylase synthetase.

Usually the physical symptoms of the syndrome affect the senses or movement. Common symptoms include blindness, partial or total paralysis, inability to speak, deafness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, balance problems, seizures, tremors, and difficulty walking.

It can affectmonochorionic multiples, that is,multiple pregnancieswhere two or morefetusesshare achorionand hence a singleplacenta. Severe TTTS has a 60100% mortality rate.As a result of sharing a single placenta, the blood supplies ofmonochorionictwin fetuses can become connected, so that they share blood circulation: although each fetus uses its own portion of the placenta, the connecting blood vessels within the placenta allow blood to pass from one twin to the other. It is thought that most monochorionic placentae have these "shared connections" that cross the placenta, with the net flow volumes being equal between them.This state is sometimes referred to as "flow balance". When the placenta has deep veinartery connection this can cause blood flow to become unbalanced.Depending on the number, type and direction of the interconnectingblood vessels(anastomoses), blood can be transferred disproportionately from one twin (the "donor") to the other (the "recipient"), due to a state of "flow imbalance" imparted by new blood vessel growth across the placental "equator", the line that divides each baby''s proportion of the shared placenta. This state of transfusion causes the donor twin to have decreased blood volume, retarding the donor''s development and growth, and also decreasedurinaryoutput, leading to a lower than normal level ofamniotic fluid(becomingoligohydramnios). The blood volume of the recipient twin is increased, which can strain the fetus''s heart and eventually lead to heart failure, and also higher than normal urinary output, which can lead to excess amniotic fluid (becomingpolyhydramnios). The demise of the fetus is typically a result of ischemia related to the lack of blood flow. The lack of blood flow causes bowel atresia, brain damage, andkidney failure.' WHERE code = 'Q1409160';

Inside the tunnel, the nerve splits into three segments. One nerve (calcaneal) continues to the heel, the other two (medial and lateral plantar nerves) continue on to the bottom of the foot. The tarsal tunnel is delineated by bone on the inside and the flexor retinaculum on the outside.Patients with TTS typically complain of numbness in the foot radiating to thebig toeand the first three toes,pain, burning, electrical sensations, and tingling over the base of the foot and the heel.Depending on the area of entrapment, other areas can be affected.  If the entrapment is high, the entire foot can be affected as varying branches of the tibial nerve can become involved. Ankle pain is also present in patients who have high level entrapments. Inflammation or swelling can occur within this tunnel for a number of reasons. The flexor retinaculum has a limited ability to stretch, so increased pressure will eventually cause compression on the nerve within the tunnel. As pressure increases on the nerves, the blood flow decreases.Nerves respond with altered sensations like tingling and numbness.

Without this marker, proteins are instead secreted outside the cell, which is the default pathway for proteins moving through theGolgi apparatus.  Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans)in various tissues throughout the body (i.e. fibroblasts). As a result, a buildup of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristicI-cells, or "inclusion cells" seen microscopically. In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood, but they remain inactive at blood pH (around 7.4) because they require the low lysosomal pH 5 to function.Mucolipidosis II (ML II) is a particularly severe form of ML that has a significant resemblance to anothermucopolysaccharidosiscalledHurler syndrome.

Those born with the disease also experience severe ocular and brain defects. Half of all children with WWS are born with encephalocele, which is a gap in the skull that will not seal. The meninges of the brain protrude through this gap due to the neural tube failing to close during development. A malformation of the a baby''s cerebellum is often a sign of this disease.

The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the work ofHugo Liepmann,Adolph Kussmaul,Arnold Pick,Paul Flechsig,Hermann Munk,Carl Nothnagel,Theodor Meynert,  and linguistHeymann Steinthal, among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as "ideo-kinetic apraxia" by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution.The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought to be related to the areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the leftparietal lobeand thepremotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.Ideomotor apraxia (IMA) impinges on one''s ability to carry out common, familiar actions on command, such as waving goodbye.

An alteration in the occurrence and timing of these signals leads to a set of syndromes called Neurocristopathies (NCP), which comprises a broad spectrum of congenital malformations affecting an appreciable percentage of newborns.Moreover, since NCC migrate along the embryo, they are susceptible to subtle changes in the environment both during their migration and upon arrival at their destination.

Yet, the vast majority of affected individuals become clinically manifest by the time they reach adolescence.Osteochondromas occur in 3% of the general population and represent 35% of all benign tumors and 8% of all bone tumors. The majority of these tumors are solitary non-hereditary lesions and approximately 15% of osteochondromas occur ashereditary multiple exostosespreferably known as hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMOs).Osteochondromas do not result from injury and the exact cause remains unknown. Recent research has indicated that multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line mutations inEXT1andEXT2genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease.The treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements.In hereditary multiple exostoses the indications of surgery are based upon multiple factors that are taken collectively, namely: patient''s age, tumor location and number, accompanying symptomatology, esthetic concerns, family history and underlying gene mutation.A variety of surgical procedures have been employed to remedy hereditary multiple exostoses such as osteochondroma excision, bone lengthening, corrective osteotomy and hemiepiphysiodesis.

However, because of the deficiency, the final intermediate of the GABA degradation pathway, succinic semialdehyde, accumulates and cannot be oxidized to succinic acid and is therefore reduced togamma-hydroxybutyric acid(GHB) by gamma-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase.

A mutation occurs at the Bruton''s tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptorBCR.

They identified the cause of this neurological disease to be occupational exposure to aerosolized pig neural tissue.Investigators from the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) simultaneously determined that the 70 ppsi pressure used to liquefy and extract the pig brains caused the aerosolization of the pig neural tissue, sending it into the air in a fine mist.The workers closest in proximity to the "head" table, the area in the plant where high pressured air was used to evacuate the brain tissue from the pig''s skull, were the most likely to be affected.The aerosolized mist was inhaled and readily absorbed into the workers'' mucus membranes. The pig neural tissue was recognized by their systems as foreign and an immune response was initiated.The pigantigenwas found most prominently in the nerve roots of the spine which were also swollen.Researchers determined that the irritation was due to thevoltage-gated potassium channelsbeing blocked.They identified 125 1--dendrotoxinas theantagonistthat binds to and blocks the channels, causing anintracellularbuild-up of potassiumionswhich causes inflammation and irritation, and consequently, hyper-excitability in theperipheral nervous system.

There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen.Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such asmultiple sclerosis (MS),stroke,pseudohypoparathyroidism,hypocalcemia,hypoglycemia,hyperglycemia,central nervous systemtrauma, orperipheral nervous systemtrauma.PKD has also been linked withinfantile convulsions and choreoathetosis(ICCA) syndrome, in which patients haveafebrileseizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life.This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias are often inherited in anautosomal dominantfashion and several genes have now been identified where mutations can cause this disease. The genes typically code for proteins known to be involved in synaptic transmission, ion channels or ion transporters.The first gene to be identified was thePRRT2gene on chromosome 16, found in 2011 to be the cause of the disease in some patients.The mutations in this gene included anonsense mutationidentified in thegenomeof one family and aninsertion mutationidentified in the genome of another family.Researchers foundPRRT2mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKD, thus suggestsPRRT2is the gene mutated in a subset of PKD and PKD is genetically heterogeneous.Later reports have identified the genesSCN8A,CHRNA4, andSLC16A2as further causes of PKD.'

The symptoms and clinical manifestations of frontal lobe epilepsy can differ depending on which specific area of the frontal lobe is affected.The onset of a seizure may be hard to detect since the frontal lobes contain and regulate many structures and functions about which relatively little is known. Due to the lack of knowledge surrounding the functions associated with the frontal lobes, seizures occurring in these regions of the brain may produce unusual symptoms which can often be misdiagnosed as apsychiatric disorder,non-epileptic seizureor a sleep disorder.'

Unfortunately, depression is a common symptom found in patients with schizophrenia and can fly under the radar for years before others become aware of its presence in a patient.However, very little research has been done on the subject, meaning there are few answers to how it should be systematically diagnosed, treated, or what course the illness will take.Some scientists would entirely deny the existence of post-schizophrenic depression, insisting it is a phase in schizophrenia as a whole.  As of late, post-schizophrenic depression has become officially recognized as a syndrome and is considered asub-typeof schizophrenia.Because the nature of acute schizophrenia is similar to depression, it is difficult to differentiate normal levels of depression in patients with schizophrenia from depressive levels in post-schizophrenic depression.  "Prominent subjectively low mood, suggesting depression, and prominent blunting of affect, suggesting negative symptoms, are the two features which are most helpful in differentiating ."A number of researchers believe that depression is actually a symptom of schizophrenia that has been hidden by the psychosis.However, symptoms usually arise after the first psychotic episodes if they will arise at all.Officially, diagnosing post-schizophrenia depression in a patient requires for the patient to be experiencing a depressive episode of either short or long term following the overcoming of schizophrenia.  The patient must still demonstrate some schizophrenic symptoms but those symptoms must no longer be the focus of the illness.  Typically, the depressive symptoms are not severe enough to be classified as a severe depressive episode.Formally, diagnosis entails the patient having had schizophrenia within the past year, a number of schizophrenic symptoms, and depression being present for two weeks or more.Mild schizophrenic signs may be withdrawing socially, agitation or hostility, and irregular sleep such as in the case ofinsomniaandhypersomnia.'

It begins by early adulthood, and it is present in a variety of contexts and is associated with inadequate functioning. Symptoms can include anything from extreme passivity, devastation or helplessness when relationships end, avoidance of responsibilities and severe submission.People who have dependent personality disorder are overdependent on other people when it comes to making decisions. They cannot make a decision on their own as they need constant approval from other people. Consequently, individuals diagnosed with DPD tend to place needs and opinions of others above their own as they do not have the confidence to trust their decisions. This kind of behaviour can explain why people with DPD tend to show passive and clingy behaviour. These individuals display a fear of separation and cannot stand being alone. When alone, they experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their overwhelming dependence on other people.

The skin lesions sometimes cause itching, which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg''s disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed, some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance. The cause of the capillary inflammation is usually unknown.The lesions are most frequent on the lower limbs, but may occur anywhere on the body, including the hands, arms, torso and even the neck.

Individuals with hippocampal sclerosis have similar initial symptoms and rates of dementia progression to those withAlzheimer''s disease(AD) and therefore are frequently misclassified as having Alzheimer''s Disease. But clinical and pathologic findings suggest that hippocampal sclerosis has characteristics of a progressive disorder although the underlying cause remains elusive.A diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis has a significant effect on the life of patients because of the notable mortality,morbidityand social impact related toepilepsy, as well as side effects associated with antiepileptic treatments.Histopathologicalhallmarks of hippocampal sclerosis include segmental loss ofpyramidal neurons,granule celldispersionand reactive gliosis. This means that pyramidal neuronal cells are lost, granule cells are spread widely or driven off, and glial cells are changed in response to damage to the central nervous system (CNS).
Generally, hippocampal sclerosis may be seen in some cases of epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy. It is important to clarify the nature of insults that most likely have caused the hippocampal sclerosis and have initiated the epileptogenic process.Presence of hippocampal sclerosis and duration of epilepsy longer than 10 years were found to causeparasympatheticautonomicdysfunction, whereas seizure refractoriness was found to causesympatheticautonomic dysfunction. Apart from its association with the chronic nature of epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis was shown to have an important role in internal cardiac autonomic dysfunction.

One possible factor could be the natural accumulation ofironin the basal ganglia, causing neurodegeneration due to its involvement in toxic,free-radicalreactions.Though motor disorders are the most common associated with the basal ganglia, recent research shows that basal ganglia disorders can lead to other dysfunctions such asobsessivecompulsive disorder(OCD) andTourette syndrome.'

Disruptions of cerebral cortical development due to abnormal neuronal migration and positioning usually lead to cortical disorders, which includescobblestone lissencephaly. Cobblestone lissencephaly is typically seen in three different human congenital muscular dystrophy syndromes:Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy,Walker-Warburg syndrome, andmuscle-eye-brain disease.In cobblestone lissencephaly, the brain surface actually has a bumpy contour caused by the presence of collections of misplaced neurons andglial cellsthat have migrated beyond the normal surface boundaries of the brain.

The name cadang-cadang comes from the wordgadang-gadangthat means dying inBicol.It was originally reported onSan Miguel Islandin thePhilippinesin 1927/1928. "By 1962, all but 100 of 250,000 palms on this island had died from the disease," indicating an epidemic.Every year one million coconut palms are killed by CCCVd and over 30 million coconut palms have been killed since Cadang-cadang has been discovered. CCCVd directly affects the production ofcopra, a raw material for coconut oil and animal feed. Total losses of about 30 million palms and annual yield losses of about 22,000 tons of copra have been attributed to Cadang-cadang disease in the Philippines.Viroidsare small, single-strandedRNAmolecules, ranging from 246 to 375nucleotideslong. Unlikeviruses, they do not code for protein coats but contain genes for autonomous replication. With abilities to cause serious disease, they are more commonly found in a latent stage, and their mode of infection is mainly mechanical, though documented cases exist of vertical transmission through pollen and seed.The sequence and structure prediction of CCCVd has been documented. There are four low-molecular-weight RNA species (ccRNAs) found associated with cadang-cadang disease.Of the four, two are related with the early stage of the disease: ccRNA 1 fast and ccRNA 2 fast.

Parathyroid related hypocalcemia includes post-surgicalhypoparathyroidism, inherited hypoparathyroidism,pseudohypoparathyroidism, and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism.Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism is the most common form, and can be temporary (due to suppression of tissue after removal of a malfunctioning gland) or permanent, if all parathyroid tissue has been removed.Inherited hypoparathyroidism is rare and is due to a mutation in the calcium sensing receptor. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is maternally inherited and is categorized by hypocalcemia andhyperphosphatemia. Finally, pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism is paternally inherited.

Its functions include: promoting growth, increasing  basal metabolic rate and controlling body temperature.Adequate iodine intake is necessary for the production of thyroid hormone. According to Payton R. G. et al., a common disorder of the thyroid gland is hypothyroidism, which is more prevalent in women than in men. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include cold intolerance, weight gain, fatigue, anemia, difficulty concentrating, amenorrhea,bradycardia(low heart rate) and goiter.Another hormone that is secreted by Para follicular cells of the thyroid gland is calcitonin.Calcitonin works in an antagonistic fashion with parathyroid hormone (PTH): both regulate the level of calcium in the blood.Blood calciumlevel is tightly regulated by these two hormones. The cells of our bone that is involved in bone formation and bone breakdown is osteoblast and osteoclast respectively. Osteoclasts are cells of bones that promote bone demineralization or boneresorption.In contrast, Osteoblast promotescalciumabsorptionby the bone therefore, promoting bone mineralization and formation of new bones.Thus Calcitonin activates osteoblasts, therefore decrease blood calcium levels by decreasing bone breakdown (resorption) by inhibiting osteoclast. Whereas, PTH activates osteoclast and thereby increases blood calcium.  The hormone produced by thethyroid glandhas big impact on bone density, blood calcium levee.

Dissection refers to the actual tearing open of the aorta. However, the exact gene(s) involved has not yet been identified.It can occur in the absence of clinical features ofMarfan syndromeand ofsystemic hypertension.Over time this weakness, along withsystolic pressure, results in a tear in the aorticintimalayer thus allowing blood to enter between the layers of tissue and cause further tearing. Eventually complete rupture of the aorta occurs and thepleural cavityfills with blood. Warning signs include chest pain,ischemia, and hemorrhaging in the chest cavity. This condition, unless found and treated early, usually results in death. Immediate surgery is the best treatment in most cases.FAD is not to be confused with PAU (penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers) and IMH (intramural hematoma), both of which present in ways similar to that of familial aortic dissection.Inheritance is thought to be rather complex.

As such, the clinical manifestations of the disorder are the result of this chronic stress caused by the above three factors. The "classic" description was previously a "thin woman who undereats and overexercises,"but recent studies are finding FHA can also present as a "high-achieving individual"with poor stress-management behaviors that include under- or over-eating and overexercising.It therefore follows that there may also be symptoms of thefemale athlete triad,eating disorders, low bone density, orosteoporosis.Some may willing consume insufficient calories in conjunction with or independent of an underlyingeating disorder, meaning that women with FHA may be normal weight or underweight.In amenorrheic athletes who have a near-normal weight, menses may be restored during periods of deceased training.The fact that nutritional restoration is insufficient for restoring menses in some women highlights the influence that psychological issues, including mood disorders and obsessive patterns of behavior such as hyper-exercise and/or restrictive eating behavior, impart on the etiology of FHA.'

The ICCA syndrome was first reported in 1997 in four French families from north-western France and provided the first genetic evidence for common mechanisms shared by benign infantile seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia.The epileptic origin of PKC has long been a matter of debatesand PD have been classified as reflex epilepsies.Indeed, attacks of PKC and epileptic seizures have several characteristics in common, they both are paroxysmal in presentation with a tendency to spontaneous remission, and a subset of PKC responds well toanticonvulsants. This genetic disease has been mapped tochromosome 16p-q12.More than 30 families with the clinical characteristics of ICCA syndrome have been described worldwide so far.The specific and familial association of BIFE and PKC defines a novel clinical entity : the infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis syndrome. The first observation was made in four families where children were affected with nonfebrileconvulsionsat age 312 months. Partial epileptic seizures started with a psychomotor arrest and a deviation of the head and eyes to one side, followed inconstantly by unilateral jerks. In some cases, seizures generalized secondarily. None of the interictal electroencephalograms showed epileptiform abnormalities, and magnetic-resonance imaging were normal. These convulsions had a favorable outcome. At 58 years of age affected children  developed abnormal movements. They presented with twisting movements of the hands of a reptilian type when stressed or embarrassed. They also developed jerky movements of the legs after running. Initially, abnormal movements were intermediate in speed between quick and slow, typical of paroxysmal choreoathetosis. Combinations of abnormal movements involving the arms, legs, trunk and occasionally the head were observed. The attacks lasted only a few minutes, occurring with a frequency of 5-30 episodes per day and were not accompanied by unconsciousness.

This impairment is classified by deficiencies in expressive and receptive language development that is not attributed to sensory deficits, nonverbal intellectual deficits, a neurological condition, environmental deprivation or psychiatric impairments.Research illustrates that 2% to 4% of five year olds have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This distinction is made when children have issues in expressive language skills, the production of language, and when children also have issues in receptive language skills, the understanding of language. Those with mixed receptive-language disorder have a normal left-right anatomical asymmetry of theplanum temporaleand parietale. This is attributed to a reduced left hemisphere functional specialization for language. Taken from a measure of cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in phonemic discrimination tasks, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder do not exhibit the expected predominant left hemisphere activation.Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is also known as receptive-expressive language impairment (RELI) or receptive language disorder.If assessed on theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, for instance, symptoms of mixed receptive-expressive language disorder may show as relatively low scores for Information, Vocabulary and Comprehension (perhaps below the 25th percentile).

In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized bymicromelia(short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay ofossification(bone cell formation),platyspondyly(flattenedvertebrae), irregularmetaphyses, an array of facial aberrations andrespiratory distressrelated to chronicinfection. Opsismodysplasia iscongenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder israre, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in anautosomalrecessivepattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder islocatedon anautosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder. It is similar tospondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type.Opsismodysplasia can be characterized by a delay inbone maturation, which refers to "bone aging", an expected sequence of developmental changes in the skeleton corresponding to the chronological age of a person. Factors such as gender and ethnicity also play a role in bone age assessment. The only indicator of physical development that can be applied from birth through mature adulthood is bone age. Specifically, the age and maturity of bone can be determined by its state ofossification, the age-related process whereby certaincartilaginousand soft tissue structures are transformed into bone. The condition ofepiphyseal plates(growth plates) at the ends of thelong bones(which includes those of the arms, hands, legs and feet) is another measurement of bone age. The evaluation of both ossification and the state of growth plates in children is often reached throughradiography(X-rays) of thecarpals(bones of thehandandwrist).In opsismodysplasia, the process of ossification in long bones can be disrupted by a failure ofossification centers(a center of organization in long bones, where cartilage cells designated to await and undergo ossification gather and align in rows)to form. This was observed in a 16-month-old boy with the disorder, who had no apparent ossification centers in thecarpals(bones of the hand and wrist) ortarsals(bones of the foot).

Recent research has indicated that multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant inherited disease. Germ line mutations inEXT1andEXT2genes located on chromosomes 8 and 11 have been associated with the cause of the disease.The treatment choice for osteochondroma is surgical removal of solitary lesion or partial excision of the outgrowth, when symptoms cause motion limitations or nerve and blood vessel impingements.In hereditary multiple exostoses the indications of surgery are based upon multiple factors that are taken collectively, namely: patient''s age, tumor location and number, accompanying symptomatology, esthetic concerns, family history and underlying gene mutation.A variety of surgical procedures have been employed to remedy hereditary multiple exostoses such as osteochondroma excision, bone lengthening, corrective osteotomy and hemiepiphysiodesis.

This means that the heart is working against higher pressures, which makes it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.In a fetus, there is highpulmonary vascular resistance(PVR) and low pulmonary blood flow as the fetus does not use the lungs for oxygen transfer, but instead relies on the placenta for oxygen. When the baby is born, the lungs are needed for oxygen transfer and need high blood flow which is encouraged by low PVR. The failure of the circulatory system of the newborn to adapt to these changes by lowering PVR leads to persistent fetal circulation.The newborn is therefore born with elevated PVR, which leads topulmonary hypertension.

About 2030% of people with cerebral palsy have spastic hemiplegia.Due to brain or nerve damage, the brain is constantly sending action potentials to theneuromuscular junctionson the affected side of the body. Similar to strokes, damage on the left side of the brain affects the right side of the body and damage on the right side of the brain affects the left side of the body.

The affected side of the body is rigid, weak and has low functional abilities.In most cases, the upper extremity is much more affected than the lower extremity.

Some patients with spastic hemiplegia only suffer minor impairments, where in severe cases one side of the body could be completelyparalyzed. The severity of spastic hemiplegia is dependent upon the degree of the brain or nerve damage.There are many different brain dysfunctions that can account for the cause for spastic hemiplegia. Spastic hemiplegia occurs either at birth or in the womb. The cause can be all types ofstrokes, head injuries,hereditary diseases, brain injuries and infections.Malformations of the veins or arteries in any part of the body can lead to spastic hemiplegia.

The most prominent characteristic of toxic encephalopathy is an altered mental status.  Acute intoxication is a reversible symptom of exposure to many synthetic chemical neurotoxicants.  Acute intoxication symptoms include lightheadedness, dizziness, headache and nausea, and regular cumulative exposure to these toxic solvents over a number of years puts the individual at high risk for developing toxic encephalopathy.  Chronic exposure to low levels of neurotoxic chemicals can also cause reversible changes in mood and affect which resolve with cessation of exposure.  Acute and chronic toxic encephalopathy on the other hand, are persistent changes in neurological function that typically occur with exposure to higher concentrations and longer durations respectively.  The symptoms of acute and chronic toxic encephalopathy do not resolve with cessation of exposure and can includememory loss, small personality changes/increased irritability, insidious onset of concentration difficulties, involuntary movements (parkinsonism),fatigue,seizures, arm strength problems, anddepression.A paper by Feldman and colleagues described neurobehavioral effects in a 57-year-old house painter with regular exposure to large amounts of solvents..'

The cause of this disease is a mutation in theDLX3(distal-less 3) gene, which controls hair follicledifferentiationandinductionof bone formation. One-hundred percent of patients with TDO suffer from two co-existing conditions calledenamel hypoplasiaandtaurodontismin which the abnormal growth patterns of the teeth result in severe external and internal defects.The hair defects are characterized as being rough, course, with profuse shedding. Hair is curly and kinky at infancy but later straightens. Dental defects are characterized by dark-yellow/brownish colored teeth, thin and/or possibly pittedenamel, that is malformed. The teeth can also look normal in color, but also have a physical impression of extreme fragility and thinness in appearance. Additionally, severe underbites where the top and bottom teeth fail to correctly align may be present; it is common for the affected individual to have a larger, more pronounced lower jaw and longer bones. The physical deformities that TDO causes become more noticeable with age, and emotional support for the family as well as the affected individual is frequently recommended. Adequate treatment for TDO is a team based approach,  mostly involving physical therapists, dentists, and oromaxillofacial surgeons. Genetic counseling is also recommended.Hair abnormalities are very prominent in majority of the cases of TDO. Kinky/curly hair that is unusually dry and easily sheds is present at birth.

Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known asosteitis fibrosa,osteodystrophia fibrosa, andvon Recklinghausen''s disease of bone(not to be confused with von Recklinghausen''s disease,neurofibromatosis type I), is caused byhyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus ofparathyroid hormonefrom over-activeparathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity ofosteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclasticbone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by aparathyroid adenoma,hereditaryfactors,parathyroid carcinoma, orrenal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, includingcalcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and includebone fractures,kidney stones,nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.First described in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected through a combination ofblood testing,X-rays, andtissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare.

It affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all Glycogen Storage Diseases being type IV.It is a result of the absence of theglycogen branching enzyme, which is critical in the production ofglycogen. This leads to very long unbranched glucose chains being stored in glycogen. The long unbranched molecules have a low solubility which leads to glycogen precipitation in the liver. These deposits subsequently build up in the body tissue, especially theheartandliver. The inability to breakdown glycogen in muscle cells causes muscle weakness.

In some cases, the infection can then group around corneal nerves, producing radial deposits (radial keratoneuritis), and causing extreme pain. These are features also seen in viral andbacterial keratitis, and may be misleading.The organism is also capable of invading deeper into the cornea; usingmetalloproteasesit is able to penetrate deep into thestromaof the cornea.As the disease progresses, it may penetrate through cornea but very rarely causes infection inside the eye (endophthalmitis) due to a robust neutrophil response in theanterior chamber.'
