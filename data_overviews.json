Sulfapyridine is no longer prescribed for treatment of infections inhumans.  However, it may be used to treatlinear IgA diseaseand has use inveterinary medicine.It is a goodantibacterialdrug, but its watersolubilityis verypHdependent.  Thus there is a risk ofcrystallizationwithin thebladderorurethra, which could lead to pain or blockage. As with other sulfonamides, there is a significant risk ofagranulocytosis, and this, rather than the development of resistance by bacteria, is the main reason for its decline in use.M&B 693 was one of the first generation of sulfonamide antibiotics. It was discovered byLionel Whitbyat the British firmMay & BakerLtd and logged in their Test Book on 2 November, 1937 under Code No M&B 693.",

It is anaminesynthesized by removing acarboxyl groupfrom a molecule of itsprecursor chemicalL-DOPA, which issynthesizedin the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as aneurotransmittera chemical released byneurons(nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinctdopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component ofreward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,and manyaddictivedrugsincrease dopamine release or block itsreuptakeinto neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved inmotor controland in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways andcell groupsform a dopamine system which isneuromodulatory.In popular culture and media, dopamine is usually seen as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confersmotivational salience;in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.",

Although there is little research overall, there has been compelling initial evidence for personality change. The development of personality is often dependent on the stage of life a person is in, and the extent to which one's levels of characteristics, relative to their age cohort, is stable across long periods of time.Cultural and environmental influence are large factors in personality trait differences.Personality change is usually seen over longer periods of time and is analogical to height, as most development occurs in the earlier stages of life and becomes more stable as one grows into adulthood.The Big Five, or Five Factor Model, is the most widely accepted form of personality theory, and especially in terms of personality change.Research suggests that genetics play a role in the change and stability of certain traits in a personality. They have also discovered environmental and situational/contextual sources affect personality.Some debates have pervaded the field of psychology since its beginning. One of the most debated deals with the nature and development of personality. Personality psychology studies one's distinctive style ofcognition, behavior, andaffect. However, this concept elicits discord among psychologists as some have insisted that it does not exist,while others struggle with issues of measurement.Personality, one's characteristic way of feeling, behaving and thinking, is often conceptualized as a person's standing on eachBig Five personality trait(extraversion,neuroticism,openness to experience,agreeablenessandconscientiousness). A person's personality profile is thus gauged from their standing on five broad concepts which predict, among other life outcomes, behavior and the quality of interpersonal relationships. Initially, it was believed that one's Big Five profile was static and dichotomous in that one was either at one extreme of each trait or anotherFor example, people are typically categorized asintrovertedorextraverted. Personality was therefore assessed in terms of generalities or averages. In noticing the strong inconsistencies in how people behaved across situations, some psychologists dismissed personality as nonexistent.",

These stages areprophase,prometaphase,metaphase,anaphase, andtelophase. During mitosis, the chromosomes, which have already duplicated, condense and attach to spindlefibersthat pull one copy of each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.The result is two genetically identical daughter nuclei. The rest of the cell may then continue to divide by cytokinesis to produce two daughter cells.The different phases of mitosis can be visualized in real time, usinglive cell imaging.Producing three or more daughter cells instead of the normal two is a mitotic error called tripolar mitosis or multipolar mitosis (direct cell triplication / multiplication).Other errors during mitosis can induceapoptosis(programmed cell death) or causemutations.

    "overview": "Polyuria(/plijri/) is excessive or an abnormally large production orpassageofurine(greater than 2.5 Lor 3 Lover 24 hours in adults). Increased production and passage of urine may also be termeddiuresis.Polyuria often appears in conjunction withpolydipsia(increased thirst), though it is possible to have one without the other, and the latter may be a cause or an effect.Primary polydipsiamay lead to polyuria.Polyuria is usually viewed as asymptomorsignof anotherdisorder(not a disease by itself), but it can be classed as a disorder, at least when its underlying causes are not clear.The most common cause of polyuria in both adults and children is uncontrolleddiabetes mellitus,which causesosmotic diuresis, when glucose levels are so high that glucose is excreted in the urine. Water follows the glucose concentration passively, leading to abnormally high urine output. In the absence of diabetes mellitus, the most common causes are decreased secretion of aldosterone due to adrenal cortical tumor,primary polydipsia(excessive fluiddrinking),central diabetes insipidusandnephrogenic diabetes insipidus.Polyuria may also be due to various chemical substances, such asdiuretics,caffeine, andethanol. It may also occur aftersupraventricular tachycardias, during an onset ofatrial fibrillation,childbirth, and the removal of an obstruction within theurinary tract. Diuresis is controlled byantidiureticssuch asvasopressin,angiotensin IIandaldosterone.Cold diuresisis the occurrence of increased urine production on exposure to cold, which also partially explainsimmersion diuresis.High-altitude diuresisoccurs at altitudes above 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and is a desirable indicator ofadaptation to high altitudes. Mountaineers who are adapting well to high altitudes experience this type of diuresis. Persons who produce less urine even in the presence of adequate fluid intake are probably not adapting well to altitude.",

UV radiation is present insunlight, and constitutes about 10% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced byelectric arcsand specialized lights, such asmercury-vapor lamps,tanning lamps, andblack lights. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered anionizing radiationbecause itsphotonslack the energy toionizeatoms, it can causechemical reactionsand causes many substances to glow orfluoresce. Consequently, the chemical and biological effects of UV are greater than simple heating effects, and many practical applications of UV radiation derive from its interactions with organic molecules.Short-wave ultraviolet light damagesDNAand sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact. For humans,suntanandsunburnare familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light, along with an increased risk ofskin cancer. The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere.More energetic, shorter-wavelength \"extreme\" UV below 121 nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground.However, ultraviolet light (specifically, UVB) is also responsible for the formation ofvitamin Din most land vertebrates, including humans.The UV spectrum, thus, has effects both beneficial and harmful to life.",

The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954.Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protectiveantigen(PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) andlethal factor(LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components areendocytosed. In theendosome, the enzymatic components of the toxintranslocateinto thecytoplasmof a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed formacrophagecells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade theimmune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal.Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation ofmacromolecular assemblies, and onprotein translocation, pore formation,endocytosis, and otherbiochemicalprocesses.Anthrax is a disease caused byBacillus anthracis, a spore-forming,Gram positive, rod-shaped bacterium (Fig. 1). The lethality of the disease is caused by the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: (i) thepolyglutamic acidcapsule, which is anti-phagocytic, and (ii) the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin.

Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of \"wanting\" and \"liking\".  \"Wanting\" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward.  \"Liking\", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward.The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two.Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either \"liking\" or \"wanting\" is lacking.",

It can have medical implications but is also a regulatory response, allowing change in blood supply to different tissues throughvasodilation. Clinically, hyperaemia in tissues manifest aserythema(redness of the skin) because of the engorgement of vessels with oxygenated blood.Hyperaemia can also occur due to a fall in atmospheric pressure outside the body. The term is from Greek  (huper, \"over\") +  (haima, blood).Functional hyperaemia is an increase in blood flow to a tissue due to the presence of metabolites and a change in general conditions. When a tissue increases activity there is a well-characterized fall in the partial pressure of oxygen and pH, an increase in  partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and a rise in temperature and the concentration of potassium ions. The mechanisms ofvasodilationare predominantly local metabolites and myogenic effects.  Increased metabolic activity of the tissue leads to a local increase in the extracellular concentration of such chemicals as adenosine, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid, and a decrease in oxygen and pH.  These changes cause significant vasodilation.  The reverse occurs when metabolic activity is slowed and these substances wash out of the tissues.  The myogenic effect refers to the inherent attempt of vascular smooth muscle surrounding arterioles and arteries to maintain the tension in the wall of these blood vessels by dilating when internal pressure is reduced and to constrict when wall tension increases.",

It is usually a symptom of a greater problem, not a disease in itself. Foot drop is characterized by inability or impaired ability to raise the toes or raise the foot from the ankle (dorsiflexion). Foot drop may be temporary or permanent, depending on the extent of muscle weakness or paralysis and it can occur in one or both feet.  In walking, the raised leg is slightly bent at the knee to prevent the foot from dragging along the ground.Foot drop can be caused by nerve damage alone or by muscle or spinal cord trauma, abnormal anatomy, atoxins, or disease. Toxins include organophosphate compounds which have been used aspesticidesand as chemical agents in warfare. The poison can lead to further damage to the body such as a neurodegenerative disorder called organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. This disorder causes loss of function of the motor and sensory neural pathways.  In this case, foot drop could be the result of paralysis due to neurological dysfunction. Diseases that can cause foot drop include trauma to the posterolateral neck of fibula,stroke,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,muscular dystrophy,poliomyelitis,Charcot Marie Tooth disease,multiple sclerosis,cerebral palsy,hereditary spastic paraplegia,GuillainBarre syndrome,Welander distal myopathy, andFriedreich's ataxia.

Eventually, it can lead tocirrhosisof the liver andliver failure. PSC increases the risk of various cancers includingliver cancer,gallbladder carcinoma,colorectal cancer, andcholangiocarcinoma.The underlying cause of PSC is unknown. Genetic susceptibility,immune system dysfunction, andabnormal composition of the gut floramay play a role.This is further suggested by the observation that approximately 75% of individuals with PSC also haveinflammatory bowel disease(IBD), most oftenulcerative colitis.",

The affected bones show signs of dysregulated bone remodeling at the microscopic level, specifically excessive bone breakdown and subsequent disorganized new bone formation.These structural changes cause the bone to weaken, which may result in deformity, pain,fractureorarthritisof associated joints.The exact cause is unknown, although leading theories indicate both genetic and acquired factors (seeCauses). Paget's disease may affect any one or multiple bones of the body (most commonlypelvis,tibia,femur,lumbar vertebrae, andskull), but never the entire skeleton,and does not spread from bone to bone.Rarely, a bone affected by Paget's disease can transform into amalignant bone cancer.",

The standard therapy ofpegylated interferonandribavirinis less effective than telaprevir in those with genotype 1.In arandomized controlled trial(PROVE3) of patients in whom standard treatment withpeginterferon alfa-2aand ribavirin had failed, repeat treatment with the addition of telaprevir was more likely to have a sustained virological response (SVR) than repeat treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone.In patients who received peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for a year, the addition of telaprevir for 24 weeks achieved an SVR of 53% compared to 14% in patients who did not receive telaprevir. In that study, shorted treatment with only three months of telaprevir and six months of treatment peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin achieved an SVR of 51%.\nIn a second randomized controlled trial (REALIZE) of patients who had previously relapsed or had only a partial response, rates of SVR were higher in patients treated with telaprevir (83% to 88%) compared to 24% in controls.In a third trial (ADVANCE) for previously untreated patients,patients taking telaprevir had a SVR (69% to 75%) versus 44% in the control group.",

It is approved for treatment of navicular disease and distal tarsal osteoarthritis in Europe,and was approved for treatment of navicular disease in the United States in 2014.Tiludronate is a non-nitrogenous bisphosphonate that inhibitsosteoclasts, the primary cell responsible for the breakdown of bone required forbone remodeling. Non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates are metabolized by osteoclasts to compounds that then replace a portion of theadenosine triphosphate(ATP) molecule, making it non-functional. These non-functional molecules then competitively inhibit ATP in the cell, reducing cell energy and leading toapoptosis.Decreased levels of osteoclasts subsequently reduce the degree of breakdown of bone and bone turnover.

Idiomatically, \"a pathology\" may also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement \"the many different forms ofcancerhave diverse pathologies\"), and theaffixpathyis sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as incardiomyopathy) andpsychologicalconditions (such aspsychopathy).Aphysicianpracticing pathology is called apathologist.As a field of general inquiry and research, pathology addresses four components of disease: cause, mechanisms of development (pathogenesis), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of changes (clinical manifestations).In common medical practice, general pathology is mostly concerned with analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for bothinfectiousandnon-infectiousdisease, and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties,anatomical pathologyandclinical pathology.Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types (comparing, for example,cytopathology,hematopathology, andhistopathology), organs (as inrenal pathology), and physiological systems (oral pathology), as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination (as withforensic pathology).",

It is thought to be able to cure many genetic disorders or treat them over time.Between 1989 and December 2018, over 2,900 clinical trials were conducted, with more than half of them inphase I.As of 2017, Spark Therapeutics'Luxturna(RPE65 mutation-induced blindness) and Novartis'Kymriah(Chimeric antigen receptor T celltherapy) are the FDA's first approved gene therapies to enter the market. Since that time, drugs such as Novartis'ZolgensmaandAlnylam'sPatisiranhave also received FDA approval, in addition to other companies' gene therapy drugs.

Differentiation means how different the cancer cells are from normal cells.Undifferentiated cellsare cells that do not have their mature features or functionsNPC may present as a lump or a mass on both sides towards the back of the neck. These lumps usually are not tender or painful but appear as a result of the metastatic spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes, thus causing the lymph nodes to swell. Lymph nodes are defined as glands that function as part of the immune system and can be found throughout the body.Swelling of the lymph nodesin the neck is the initial presentation in many people, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph nodebiopsy. Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer may appear as headaches, a sore throat, and trouble hearing, breathing, or speaking.Additional symptoms of NPC include facial pain or numbness, blurred or double vision, trouble opening the mouth, or recurring ear infections. If the ear infection does not present with an upper respiratory tract infection, then an examination should be done on the nasopharynx. This is due to the fact that, in adults, ear infections are less common than in children.Signs and symptoms related to the primary tumor includetrismus, pain,otitis media,nasal regurgitationdue toparesis(loss of or impaired movement) of thesoft palate,hearing lossandcranial nerve palsy(paralysis).

It investigates thebiopsychosocialfactors that influence the development and course of these psychiatric disorders and treatment responses to various interventions.When psychiatrists and pediatricians first began to recognize and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the 19th century, they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era.Authors like theBronte sisters,George Eliot, andCharles Dickens, introduced new ways of thinking about the child mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind. When theJournal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, the first psychiatric journal in English, was published in 1848, child psychiatry didn't exist as its own field yet. However, some of the earliest works on the possibility of nervous disorders and \"insanity\" in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such asJane Eyre(1847),Wuthering Heights(1847),Dombey and Son(1848), andDavid Copperfield(1850), to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind. Until that time, it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the \"passions\" that affected the adult mind.",

This new modification broadened its spectrum to include Gram positive bacteria. More than 300 modifications were made to it and tested on the cephalosporin base with methoxy groups at the 7-alpha position.

It is also the inability to establish and sustain adequate or spontaneous respiration upon delivery of the newborn. It remains a serious condition which causes significant mortality and morbidity. It is an emergency condition and requires adequate and quick resuscitation measures.Perinatal asphyxia is also an oxygen deficit from the 28th week of gestation to the first seven days following delivery. It is also an insult to the fetus or newborn due to lack of oxygen or lack of perfusion to various organs and may be associated with a lack of ventilation. In accordance with WHO, perinatal asphyxia is characterised by-                                   Profound metabolic acidosis, with a PH <7.20 on umbilical cord arterial blood sample, Persistence of an APGAR score of 3 at the 5th minute,                                                           Clinical neurologic sequelae in the immediate neonatal period,Evidence  of multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period.

The 9N, 11O-oxazine ring thus formed is a hemi-aminal that is unstable under both acidic and alkaline aqueous conditions and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to form erythromycyclamine. Erythromycyclamine is a semisynthetic derivative oferythromycinin which the 9-ketogroup of the erythronolide ring has been converted to an amino group. Erythromycyclamine retains the antibacterial properties of erythromycin oral administration. The prodrug, dirithromycin, is provided as enteric coated tablets to protect it from acid catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach.\nOrally administered dirithromycin is absorbed rapidly into the plasma, largely from the small intestine. Spontaneous hydrolysis to erythromycyclamine occurs in the plasma. Oral bioavailability is estimated to be about 10%, but food does not affect absorption of the prodrug.",

Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow acardiologist, particularly acardiac electrophysiologistto select the optimal pacing modes for individual patients. A specific type of pacemakers calleddefibrillatorcombines pacemaker and defibrillator functions in a single implantable device, which should be called only defibrillator, for clarity.

    "overview": "Atrinucleotide repeat expansion, also known as a triplet repeat expansion, is theDNAmutationresponsible for causing any type ofdisordercategorized as atrinucleotide repeat disorder. These are labelled indynamical geneticsasdynamic mutations.Triplet expansion is caused byslippageduring DNA replication, also known as \"copy choice\" DNA replication.Due to the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence in these regions, 'loop out' structures may form during DNA replication while maintaining complementary base pairing between the parent strand and daughter strand being synthesized. If the loop out structure is formed from the sequence on the daughter strand this will result in an increase in the number of repeats. However, if the loop out structure is formed on the parent strand, a decrease in the number of repeats occurs. It appears that expansion of these repeats is more common than reduction. Generally, the larger the expansion the more likely they are to cause disease or increase the severity of disease. Other proposed mechanisms for expansion and reduction involve the interaction of RNA and DNA molecules.In addition to occurring duringDNA replication, trinucleotide repeat expansion can also occur duringDNA repair.When a DNA trinucleotide repeat sequence isdamaged, it may be repaired by processes such ashomologous recombination,non-homologous end joining,mismatch repairorbase excision repair. Each of these processes involves a DNA synthesis step in whichstrand slippagemight occur leading to trinucleotide repeat expansion.",

When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into assault and battery, which then became widely referred to as \"assault\". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery.

When the corebody temperaturedrops, the shiveringreflexis triggered to maintainhomeostasis. Skeletal muscles begin to shake in small movements, creating warmth by expendingenergy. Shivering can also be a response to afever, as a person may feel cold. During fever the hypothalamic set point for temperature is raised. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold until the new set point is reached. Severechillswith violent shivering are called rigors. Rigors occur because the patient's body is shivering in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point.Located in the posteriorhypothalamusnear the wall of thethird ventricleis an area called the primary motor center for shivering. This area is normally inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area but is excited by cold signals from theskinandspinal cord.  Therefore, this center becomes activated when the body temperature falls even a fraction of a degree below a critical temperature level.",

This syndrome is particularly associated with pancreatic, gastric and lungcancerand Trousseau's syndrome can be an early sign of cancersometimes appearing months to years before the tumor would be otherwise detected.Heparintherapy is recommended to prevent future clots.The Trousseau sign of malignancy should not be confused with theTrousseau sign of latent tetanycaused bylow levels of calcium in the blood.Armand Trousseaufirst described this finding in the 1860s; he later found the same sign in himself, was subsequently diagnosed withgastric cancerand died soon thereafter.Trousseau presciently attributedthromboembolismin malignancy to changes in blood composition rather than local inflammatory or mechanical forces. By correlating clinical observation with surgical and autopsy findings, Trousseau recognized that a localized cancer could induce a generalizedhypercoagulablestate in which thrombosis could occur elsewhere in the body, such as in extremities with visceral malignancy. Trousseau described several cases in which recurrent thrombosis was the presenting feature of visceral cancer, and his confidence in the utility of this connection led him to say, \"So great, in my opinion, is thesemioticvalue of phlegmasia in the cancerouscachexia, that I regard this phlegmasia as a sign of the cancerousdiathesisas certain as sanguinolenteffusioninto the serous cavities.\"",

Growing amounts of scientific knowledge, such as the health effects and treatments to substance abuse, have led to advancements in the field of addiction psychiatry. These advancements in understanding the neurobiology of rewarding behavior, along with federal funding, has allowed for ample opportunity for research in the discipline of addiction psychiatry. Addiction psychiatry is an expanding field, and currently there is a high demand for substance abuse experts in both the private and public sector.Addiction psychiatry is a relatively new subspecialty of psychiatry. As of October 1991, theAmerican Board of Psychiatry and Neurologyand theAmerican Board of Medical Specialties(ABMS), with support of theAmerican Psychiatric Association, established a \"Committee on Certification of Added Qualifications in Addiction Psychiatry.\" This was a way to identify the most educated and experienced psychiatrists in the profession; however, it was not until 1993 when \"Addiction Psychiatry\" was granted sub-specialization status. Years later, in 1997 the committee's board of trustees along with the ABMS renamed the committee \"Committee on Certification in the Subspecialty of Addiction Psychiatry\". The committee became more geared toward developing the subspecialty of addiction psychiatry.

Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via acomplete blood count(CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia.The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line.Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though inidiopathiceosinophilia, the disease may be controlled withcorticosteroids.Eosinophilia is not adisorder(rather, only asign) unless it is idiopathic.Eosinophilia can beidiopathic(primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease.In the Western World, allergic oratopicdiseases are the most common causes, especially those of therespiratoryorintegumentarysystems.

Cognitive advances and increased pressures in late childhood and early adolescence result in repeated social anxiety. Adolescents have identified their most common anxieties as focused on relationships with peers to whom they areattracted,peer rejection,public speaking,blushing,self-consciousness,panic, and past behavior. Most adolescents progress through their fears and meet the developmental demands placed on them.More and more children are being diagnosed with social anxiety, and this can lead to problems with education if not closely monitored. Part of social anxiety is fear of being criticized by others, and in children, social anxiety causes extreme distress over everyday activities such as playing with other kids, reading in class, or speaking to adults. On the other hand, some children with social anxiety willact outbecause of their fear.

Other investigators thought the unsporulatedoocystsappeared more similar tocyanobacteria, and the name \"cyanobacterium-like body\" or CLB became prevalent in the literature (occasionally, authors also used the term \"coccidian-like body\", or CLB). Eventually, Ortega et al. (1992) published an abstract reporting that they had sporulated and excysted the oocysts, resulting in placement of the parasite in the genusCyclospora.

Albinism can reduce the survivability of an animal; for example, it has been suggested that albino alligators have an average survival span of only 24 hours due to the lack of protection from UV radiation and their lack of camouflage to avoid predators.It is a common misconception that all albino animals have characteristic pink or red eyes (resulting from the lack of pigment in theirisallowing the blood vessels of the retina to be visible), however this is not the case for some forms of albinism.Familiar albino animals include in-bred strains oflaboratory animals(rats, mice and rabbits), but populations of naturally occurring albino animals exist in the wild, e.g.Mexican cave tetra.  Albinism is a well-recognized phenomenon in molluscs, both in the shell and in the soft parts.

Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part ofadjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic withchemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is calledradiation oncology.Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging theDNAof cancerous tissue leading tocellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much largerabsorbed dosethere than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.",

The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.There are two main types of amnesia:retrograde amnesiaandanterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from theshort-termstore into thelong-termstore. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to themedial temporal lobe. In addition, specific areas of thehippocampus(theCA1 region) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of thediencephalonare damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation betweendeficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice.In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recallimmediate informationis still retained,and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition,priming(both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of freshnon-declarativeknowledge.Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.",

    "overview": "Thedecompressionof adiveris the reduction inambient pressureexperienced during ascent from depth.  It is also the process of elimination of dissolved inert gases from the diver's body, which occurs during the ascent, largely during pauses in the ascent known as decompression stops, and after surfacing until the gas concentrations reach equilibrium. Divers breathing gas at ambient pressure need to ascend at a rate determined by their exposure to pressure and the breathing gas in use.  A diver who only breathes gas at atmospheric pressure whenfree-divingorsnorkellingwill not usually need to decompress, Divers using anatmospheric diving suitdo not need to decompress as they are never exposed to high ambient pressure.When a diver descends in the water thehydrostatic pressure, and therefore the ambient pressure, rises. Becausebreathing gasis supplied at ambientpressure, some of this gas dissolves into the diver's blood and is transferred by the blood to other tissues. Inert gas such asnitrogenorheliumcontinues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver'slungs, at which point the diver issaturatedfor that depth and breathing mixture, or the depth, and therefore the pressure, is changed.  During ascent, the ambient pressure is reduced, and at some stage the inert gases dissolved in any given tissue will be at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state and start to diffuse out again. If the pressure reduction is sufficient, excess gas may form bubbles, which may lead todecompression sickness, a possibly debilitating or life-threatening condition. It is essential that divers manage their decompression to avoid excessive bubble formation and decompression sickness.  A mismanaged decompression usually results from reducing the ambient pressure too quickly for the amount of gas in solution to be eliminated safely.  These bubbles may block arterial blood supply to tissues or directly cause tissue damage.  If the decompression is effective, theasymptomaticvenous microbubblespresent after most dives are eliminated from the diver's body in thealveolar capillary bedsof the lungs. If they are not given enough time, or more bubbles are created than can be eliminated safely, the bubbles grow in size and number causing the symptoms and injuries of decompression sickness. The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver, and the long-term goal is to avoid complications due tosub-clinicaldecompression injury.",

It was developed atJanssen Pharmaceuticain 1964 and was introduced as an intravenous agent in 1972 in Europe and in 1983 in the United States.In emergency settings, etomidate was one of the most frequently used sedative hypnotic agents, howeverpropofolis now usually the drug of choice due to its significantly better properties.It is used forconscious sedationand as a part of arapid sequence inductionto induce anaesthesia.It is used as an anaesthetic agent since it has a rapid onset of action and a safe cardiovascular risk profile, and therefore is less likely to cause a significant drop in blood pressure than other induction agents.In addition, etomidate is often used because of its easy dosing profile, limited suppression of ventilation, lack of histamine liberation and protection from myocardial and cerebral ischemia.Thus, etomidate is a good induction agent for people who are hemodynamically unstable.Etomidate also has interesting characteristics for people withtraumatic brain injurybecause it is one of the only anesthetic agents able to decrease intracranial pressure and maintain a normal arterial pressure.",

Frontal lobe impairment can be detected by recognition of typical clinical signs, use of simple screening tests, and specialist neurological testing.The signs and symptoms of frontal lobe disorder can be indicated bydysexecutive syndromewhich consists of a number of symptoms which tend to occur together.Broadly speaking, these symptoms fall into three main categories; cognitive (movement and speech), emotional or behavioral. Although many of these symptoms regularly co-occur, it is common to encounter patients who have several, but not all of these symptoms. This is one reason why some researchers are beginning to argue that dysexecutive syndrome is not the best term to describe these various symptoms. The fact that many of the dysexecutive syndrome symptoms can occur alone has led some researchersto suggest that the symptoms should not be labelled as a \"syndrome\" as such.

This occurs when a muscle's motor unit is stimulated by multiple impulses at a sufficiently high frequency. Each stimulus causes a twitch. If stimuli are delivered slowly enough, the tension in the muscle will relax between successive twitches. If stimuli are delivered at high frequency, the twitches will overlap, resulting in tetanic contraction. A tetanic contraction can be either unfused (incomplete) or fused (complete).An unfused tetanus is when the muscle fibers do not completely relax before the next stimulus because they are being stimulated at a fast rate; however there is a partial relaxation of the muscle fibers between the twitches.Fused tetanus is when there is no relaxation of the muscle fibers between stimuli and it occurs during a high rate of stimulation.A fused tetanic contraction is the strongest single-unit twitch in contraction.When tetanized, the contracting tension in the muscle remains constant in asteady state. This is the maximal possible contraction.During tetanic contractions, muscles can shorten, lengthen or remain constant length.Tetanic contraction is usually normal (such as when holding up a heavy box). Muscles often exhibit some level of tetanic activity, leading tomuscle tone, in order to maintain posture;for example, in a crouching position, some muscles require sustained contraction to hold the position.

Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insecttriatomine(descriptions \"assassin bug\", \"cone-nose bug\", and \"kissing bug\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infectedfaecesis further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.TheTrypanosoma cruzilife cycle starts in an animal reservoir, usually mammals, wild or domestic, including humans. A triatomine bug serves as the vector. While taking a blood meal, it ingestsT. cruzi.

The process is characterized by changes at the cellular,genetic, andepigeneticlevels and abnormalcell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost alltissuesand under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form ofapoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues andorgans. According to the prevailing accepted theory of carcinogenesis, the somatic mutation theory,mutationsinDNAandepimutationsthat lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and theevolution of those cellsbynatural selectionin the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.Variants of inherited genes may predispose individuals to cancer. In addition, environmental factors such ascarcinogensand radiation cause mutations that may contribute to the development of cancer. Finally random mistakes in normal DNA replication may result in cancer causing mutations.A series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell.On average, for example, 15 \"driver mutations\" and 60 \"passenger\" mutations are found in colon cancers.Mutations in genes that regulate cell division,apoptosis(cell death), andDNA repairmay result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer.",

Disopyramide is available in both oral and intravenous forms, and has a low degree of toxicity.Disopyramide's Class 1a activity is similar to that ofquinidinein that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction.Disopyramide depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity.Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration.This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium.As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure.",

It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and treatment procedures, and natural gas production. It also plays a major role as a radioactive isotope present innuclear fissionproducts, and was a significant contributor to the health hazards from open-air atomic bomb testing in the 1950s, and from theChernobyl disaster, as well as being a large fraction of the contamination hazard in the first weeks in theFukushima nuclear crisis.

Seefission product yieldfor a comparison with other radioactive fission products.131I is also a major fission product of uranium-233, produced fromthorium.Due to its mode ofbeta decay, iodine-131 is notable for causingmutationand death in cells that it penetrates, and other cells up to several millimeters away. For this reason, high doses of the isotope are sometimes less dangerous than low doses, since they tend to killthyroidtissues that would otherwise become cancerous as a result of the radiation. For example, children treated with moderate dose of131I for thyroid adenomas had a detectable increase in thyroid cancer, but children treated with a much higher dose did not.Likewise, most studies of very-high-dose131I for treatment ofGraves' diseasehave failed to find any increase in thyroid cancer, even though there is linear increase in thyroid cancer risk with131I absorption at moderate doses.Thus, iodine-131 is increasingly less employed in small doses in medical use (especially in children), but increasingly is used only in large and maximal treatment doses, as a way of killing targeted tissues.

The medical term for this infection in humans and other animals issparganosis.Morphologically, these worms are similar to other worms in the genusSpirometra. They have a long body consisting of three sections: the scolex, the neck, and the strobilia.They have a complex life cycle that consists of three hosts, and can live in varying environments and bodily tissues.Humans can contract this parasite in three main ways (ingestion of under cooked meat, contaminated water, or poultices contained contaminated flesh).Historically, humans are considered a paratenic host; however, the first case of an adultS. erinaceieuropaeiinfection in humans was reported in 2017.Spirometratapeworms exist worldwide and infection is common in animals, butS. erinaceieuropaeiinfections are rare in humans.Treatment for infection typically includes surgical removal and anti-worm medication.AdultSpirometraare typically large worms with long bodies consisting of three distinguishable body sections: the scolex, the neck, and the strobilia. Overall body length can reach up to several meters; however, this can vary depending on host species as well as other factors.The scolex is the spoon shaped anterior portion of the worm and consists of the head with attachments. Instead of hooks and distinct suckers (like most tape worms),S. erinaceieuropaeihave two bothria.Bothria are grooves on the scolex that contain weak muscles that perform a sucking action. The neck is unsegmented and located between the scolex and the rest of the body.The proglottids make up the remainder of the body (everything after the neck), and together are termed the strobilia.  As proglottids mature, they develop two sets of reproductive organs, one male and one female. Each proglottid is capable of reproducing via self fertilization.Eggs are typically ovoid in shape with tapered ends.Finally, should the head and neck be severed from one or all of the proglottids,S. erinaceieuropaeican regenerate a new body.",

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known aspathogens, fromvirusestoparasitic worms, anddistinguishthem from the organism's own healthytissue. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: theinnate immune systemand theadaptive immune system.  Both subsystems usehumoral immunityandcell-mediated immunityto perform their functions.  In humans, thebloodbrain barrier,bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluidbrain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from theneuroimmune system, which protects thebrain.Pathogens can rapidlyevolveand adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simpleunicellularorganisms such asbacteriapossess a rudimentary immune system in the form ofenzymesthat protect againstbacteriophageinfections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancienteukaryotesand remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms includephagocytosis,antimicrobial peptidescalleddefensins, and thecomplement system.Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity createsimmunological memoryafter an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.

HAART decreases the patient's total burden of HIV, maintains function of theimmune system, and preventsopportunistic infectionsthat often lead to death.HAART also prevents the transmission of HIV betweenserodiscordantsame sex and opposite sex partners so long as the HIV-positive partner maintains an undetectable viral load.Treatment has been so successful that in many parts of the world, HIV has become a chronic condition in which progression toAIDSis increasingly rare.Anthony Fauci, head of the United StatesNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has written, \"With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.\" In the same paper, he noted that an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by antiretroviral therapy.As another commentary inThe Lancetnoted, \"Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades.\"",

As with other types ofaphasia, the symptoms that accompany PPA depend on what parts of theleft hemisphereare significantly damaged. However, unlike most other aphasias, PPA results from continuous deterioration in brain tissue, which leads to early symptoms being far less detrimental than later symptoms. Those with PPA slowly lose the ability to speak, write, read, and generally comprehend language. Eventually, almost every patient becomes mute and completely loses the ability to understand both written and spoken language.Although it was first described as solely impairment of language capabilities while other mental functions remain intact,it is now recognized that many, if not most of those afflicted suffer from impairment of memory, short term memory formation and loss ofexecutive functions. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by M.Marsel Mesulam in 1982.Primary progressive aphasias have a clinical and pathological overlap with thefrontotemporal lobar degeneration(FTLD) spectrum of disorders andAlzheimer's disease. However, PPA is not considered synonymous to Alzheimer's disease due to the fact that, unlike those affected by Alzheimer's disease, those with PPA are generally able to maintain the ability to care for themselves, remain employed, and pursue interests and hobbies. Moreover, in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,Pick's disease, andCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive deterioration of comprehension and production of language is just one of the many possible types of mental deterioration, such as the progressive decline of memory, motor skills, reasoning, awareness, and visuospatial skills.Currently, the specific causes for PPA and other degenerative brain disease similar to PPA are unknown. Autopsies have revealed a variety of brain abnormalities in people who had PPA. These autopsies, as well as imaging techniques such as CT scans, MRI, EEG,single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), andpositron emission tomography(PET), have generally revealed abnormalities to be almost exclusively in the left hemisphere.",

These events have profoundpsychological,physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998study on adverse childhood experiencesdetermined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthyself-destructive behaviors,risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises.Nearly 30 years of study following the initial study has confirmed this. Many states, health providers, and other groups now routinely screen parents and children for ACEs.Traumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual'sallostatic loadand thus affects theimmune system,nervous system, andendocrine system.Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes includingdepression,hypertension,autoimmune diseases,lung cancer, and premature mortality.Effects of childhood trauma onbrain developmentincludes a negative impact onemotional regulationand impairment of development ofsocial skills.Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior.Recent research has found that physical and sexual abuse are associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood, while personality disorders and schizophrenia are linked with emotional abuse as adults.",

Muteness may not be a permanent condition, depending upon etiology (cause).  In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: organic, psychological, developmental/ neurological.For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder. For adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak, loss of speech may be due to injury, disease, termedaphasia, or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur rarely for psychological reasons.Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. When there is an absence of speech, a speech assessment is strongly recommended to determine cause and treatment.Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is determined to be a permanent condition, a range of assistive and augmentative communication devices are available to aid communication.",

Its active ingredient,tubocurarine, as well as many synthetic derivatives, played a significant role in scientific experiments to determine the function ofacetylcholineinneuromuscular transmission.By 1943, neuromuscular blocking drugs became established as muscle relaxants in the practice ofanesthesiaandsurgery.",
