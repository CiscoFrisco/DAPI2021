# DAPI2021



The project’s goal is to provide an easy way of finding potential diseases based on the user’s symptoms and suggest the respective treatment.


## Potential Queries:

- Find the most probable diseases based on symptoms.

- Find treatment associated with disease.

- Find body parts associated with disease and vice-versa.

- Find the causes of a disease.

- Find the consequences of a disease.

- Filter diseases by category.

- Most lethal diseases by category.

- Most common diseases by category.


## Datasets:

For a structured dataset, we will use wikidata, which associates diseases to symptoms, treatments, and other variables that we can use to organize this information. An example of a disease in wikidata is: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11081

For obtaining textual data, we’re considering using either Wikipedia or the World Health Organization website, which possesses an overview for each disease, such as in the following example: https://www.who.int/health-topics/cervical-cancer
